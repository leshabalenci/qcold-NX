Very unlikely but better safe than sorry.\\nFixed an issue with an Animal Crossing Amiibo where the slash in its name would create an unexpected folder structure.\\nDue to the new update, you might need to manually delete the amiibos, as they lack the \"autogenerated.flag\" file and wont be deleted or overwritten by the new version of the tool. You could delete all amiibos with 1.3.0, update and then generate them again.\\n\\nThis release shows as 1.3.0 on your switch.\\n\\n1.2.0\\n\\nDownloaded Amiibo images will now be auto resized to a height of 150px (and width in aspect ratio). This will help with the fluidity inside the overlay and reduce overall filesize.\\nDownloaded Amiibo images without an alpha-channel will be converted to RGBA, to be able to display correctly in the overlay.\\n\\n1.1.0\\n\\nAdded the option to download amiibo images (very slow) and redid the \"menu\".",

Overlay options are still present if you'd prefer to play with a square aspect ratio.\\n  - Widescreen may result in slightly worse performance on some systems, but New 3DS is the only one where it's actually noticeable in my experience.\\n- Added three new background/overlay color options- and one new block color option.\\n  - Also reorganized background/overlay color options.\\n- Added Spawn Area setting- that allows the player to change the size of the block spawn area.\\n  - A larger area will be more visually appealing but have worse performance on weak devices. Conversely, a smaller area will look more cramped but improve framerate.\\n- Adjusted HUD element positions.\\n- Assorted minor polish.\\n- [Android] Increased block spawn boundaries- from 10.0 to 12.0 (same as PC).\\n- [PC] Config file now stores WINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT instead of just WINDOW_SIZE (which previously set both width and height).\\n- [Switch] Very slightly increased block spawn boundaries from 8.7 to 8.8.\\n- [Vita] Slightly improved performance. Minimum no-overclock framerate increased from 45 FPS to 52 FPS.\\n\\n Bug Fixes\\n- High score is no longer saved if debug mode is used during a game. No cheating!\\n- [Android] Fixed startup crash- on some Android versions.\\n- [PC] Toggling fullscreen no longer resets visual settings.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\nv1.1\\nMajor performance improvements and others, make sure you update!\\n\\nTechnical Improvements:\\n -Significantly optimized rendering and block logic. This means higher framerates on all systems (sometimes much higher)!\\n- The goal was usually to reach 60 FPS on the most intense settings while maintaining good block spawn boundaries, though some consoles only reach this target on less intense difficulties.\\n- Increased cube spawn boundaries on almost all consoles to take advantage of improved performance.\\nOther minor optimizations and polish.\\n\\nChanges:\\n- Enhanced controller support! Input is now read from all connected controllers, and you can freely connect/disconnect controllers as desired.\\n- Added Block Transparency setting. Disabling this can slightly improve performance if needed.\\n- Added Frame Rate setting, intended for weak hardware.\\n- Made True Analog (formerly called Type B) the default control scheme.\\n- Made Pitch Black the default overlay color.\\n- Renamed and reorganized some menu options.\\n- Added version number to credits.",

The UI has been designed to condense as many options as possible, while keeping it simple to work with.\\n\\nMoreover, Checkpoint is extremely lightweight - while being packaged with a nice graphic user interface - and is built using the most recent libraries available.\\n\\nCheckpoint for Switch natively supports NAND saves for the titles you have played. Title information are loaded automatically.\\n\\nWorking path\\n\\nCheckpoint relies on the following folders to store the files it generates. Note that all the working directories are automatically generated on first launch (or when Checkpoint finds a new title that doesn't have a working directory yet).\\n\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint: root path\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/config.json: custom configuration file\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/saves/<title id> <game title>: root path for all the save backups for a generic game\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nCheckpoint for Switch only runs on homebrew launcher. Make sure you're running up-to-date payloads.\\n\\nThe first launch will take considerably longer than usual (usually 1-2 minutes depending on how many titles you have installed), due to the working directories being created - Checkpoint will be significatively faster upon launch from then on.\\n\\nYou can scroll between the title list with the DPAD/LR and target a title with A when the selector is on it. Now, you can use the DPAD or the touchscreen to select a target backup to restore/overwrite.",
            "changelog": "v3.10.2\\nI intended to add more value to this release by trying to enhance few things here and there, but I didn't manage to do it in the short time I had to get this build ready. I hope to bring something new and fresh to Checkpoint soon to keep the spark of this project alive.\\n\\nSometimes I wish I could write this software from scratch again to incorporate into it all the cool things and concepts I learned in the last 10 years of being a Software Engineer. But focus switches from one thing to another, interests change and, most importantly, time and energy are very limited in this moment in time.\\n\\nBut there will be another moment again, in which the spark will burn at full power.\\n\\n What's new\\n\\n- Fixed: breaking compatibility issue with latest Switch OS version.\\n- Fixed: compiled with latest version of the needed dependencies.\\n- Added: cheat database updated to latest Sharkive: https://github.com/FlagBrew/Sharkive release.\\n- General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\nIf you wish to contribute, pull requests are highly appreciated.\\n\\n\\n\\n<img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"frame(10)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d43383f-c4c8-4d3c-b5ff-05e82e03c1d9\" />\\n\\nv3.10.1\\nWhat's new\\n\\n- Fixed: add support for archived, hidden and readonly 3ds save backup folders.\\n  - This bug has been in the codebase from the very beginning. Eventually, we fixed it.\\n- Fixed: a bug where some text could not be rendered on screen properly.\\n- Added: cheat database updated to latest Sharkive: https://github.com/FlagBrew/Sharkive release.\\n- General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\nIf you wish to contribute, pull requests are highly appreciated.\\n\\n3.10.0\\nFixed: startup time has been drastically improved: ~50% speedup on uncached boot, ~90% speedup on cached boot.\\nThis has been achieved by profiling the application boot process, and realizing that title cache persistence on the SD card took majority of the loading time. Now this operation is lazily done in a separate thread. It's funny to realize that a badly implemented optimization can become a bottleneck of its own, so take my mistake as a lesson.\\nHere's the improvements I had on my console (improvements may vary since they depend on how many games you have on your console):\\nUncached startup went down from 9.8s to 5.7s\\nCached startup went down from 5.7s to 0.6s\\nAdded: due to requests from multiple users, Checkpoint can now be updated from Universal Updater.\\nFixed: cartridge loading now runs immediately rather than waiting for the title cache to be persisted on the SD card.\\nFixed: properly quit the application gracefully when an handled exception occurs.\\nFixed: initial code refactoring.\\nRemoved: some redundant logs in the title loader.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n3.9.0\\nThis release mostly contains changes and patches related to the infamous 3.8.x startup crash issue affecting the 3DS version of the software. General improvements have been added to the Switch version as well.\\n\\nFixed: the startup crash issue affecting all version since 3.8.0 has been identified and patched.\\nHuge shoutout to achinech on Discord who volunteered to debug the issue on their console.\\nIf you still encounter startup crash issues, please notify the team immediately on Discord and on GitHub issues.\\nFixed: cartridge scanning has been refactored to be way more efficient.\\nPreviously, the software used to poll the cartridge synchronously for every frame of the UI thread. Cartridge scanning is now happening on a separate thread which only runs twice per second.\\nAdded: a more advanced threading framework ported from PKSM.\\nAdded: networking support and an integrated HTTP server. This is currently used to provide real-time online access to the application logs, but this code will be useful for future features like self-updating.\\nAdded: compiler optimizations are back. This includes link-time optimization and an upgrade from O2 to O3 compared to v.3.7.4.\\nFixed: better configuration file handling ported from PKSM.\\nFixed: better thread synchronization between UI thread and title loading thread.\\nFixed: wrap the entire program into try-catch blocks to prevent crashes caused by other unhandled exceptions in the future.\\nFixed: few graphics improvements.\\nFixed: readme has been updated with latest screenshots.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n3.8.2\\nAdded: Initial upgrade from C++17 to C++20\\nAdded: Built with latest Sharkive's cheats repository\\nFixed: UI has been improved and rendering has been simplified in order to make the screen render faster\\nFixed: the color scheme has been improved (to my liking)\\nFixed: a crash when playing certain games and then going directly into checkpoint afterwards\\nFixed: logs on the Switch version are now split by day. This avoids keeping a huge checkpoint.log file after years of use.\\nYou can safely remove /switch/Checkpoint/checkpoint.log.\\nYou can find the new logs under /switch/Checkpoint/logs folder.\\nLogs for the 3DS version will be added in the next releases.\\nFixed: dependencies have been updated to their latest version\\nFixed: displayed play time is now rendered correctly\\nFixed: L/R buttons double binding (thanks @Noxor11)\\nFixed: source compilation (thanks @mrhappyasthma and @l-austenfeld)\\nRemoved: link time optimizations have been disabled.\\nThese were originally introduced to strip down some weight off the compiled executable, but the difference is too small to consider this feature useful.

Most notably:\\n\\nMultiplayer co-op with up to four players\\nTouch screen support\\nIntegrated game downloader (Requires WiFi)\\nNative resolution (+ scaling options)\\n\\nAction\tButton\\nWalking directions (Left, Right, Up, Down) - Directional buttons (On left Joycon)\\nJump\tA\\nRun\tB\\nPogo\tX\\nShoot\tY\\nBack/Menu  Plus +\\nStatus\t   Minus \u2013\\nCamlead (Multiplayer)\tR\\nHelp\tL\\n\\nADDING THE GAMES\\nTo use the integrated downloader just select \u201c+ More\u201d after starting Commander Genius. Depending on the mirror the download sometimes takes up to ~30 seconds. If it still fails, just try again or download the games manually.\\n\\nIf the integrated downloader causes issues, or if one just wants to keep the Switch offline, the shareware titles can also be downloaded here and extracted to /switch/CommanderGenius/games/ on the SD card.\\n\\nNote: Besides the shareware episodes, Commander Genius also supports the commercial Commander Keen titles.\\n\\nSOURCE CODE\\nMy patches to the Switch port can be found on GitHub and were built using devkitPro. Big thanks to Gerhard Stein for Commander Genius and his support that made this port possible. We will also be working to upstream the changes so the Switch port can keep up with the latest development."

            "changelog": "3.8.37\\n\\nVery minor change, fixed LED stop working for HOS16\\nNow player two controller can also control EdiZon\\n\\n3.8.36\\n\\nKey hints is place on the cheat code label, instead of only showing up in Edizon SE now it will show on all cheat managers.\\n\\n3.8.35\\n\\nFixed a pointer chain navigation bug.\\nShow segment and module information in memory explorer.\\nAdd bookmark from cheat now works on pointer that isn't currently valid.\\nAdd bookmark from cheat now supports negative offset.\\nFixed a bug in button display string.\\n\\n3.8.34\\n\\nComparison between number that involve negative number was wrong for anything that isn't 64bit. Now it is fixed for 32bit number. (16 bit and 8 bit number not fixed).\\n\\nFor f32 R now also swap Value1 and Value2 in addition to negating them\\n\\n3.8.29\\n\\nAdded \"DiffBA\" search mode. Use Dpad down on search tab to cycle to this search mode.\\nThis search is used to find unknown value of type u32 or f32 that you can make to change the same amount. Find u32 and f32 candidates that inc or dec with the same amount of change. ( 4 in 1 )\\nStart search with \"SAME\", change the amount, search with \"NotA\", change the amount, search with \"DiffBA\", repeat ( change the amount, search with \"DiffBA\" ) until you have a short list of candidates.\\n\\nFixed a bug with unknown search.\\n\\n3.8.25g\\n\\nThis release is only tested on atmosphere 1.2.4.\\n\\nTo enable gdbstub add the this line to /atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini under [atmosphere]\\nenable_standalone_gdbstub = u8!0x1\\nRestart Switch after the change.\\nThis release will also load dmnt ( CheatVM ) as a sysmodule when GDB is enabled.\\nOnly either dmnt or GDB can be attached to the game at any one time.\\nUse ZL+B to detach dmnt ( and the \"no auto attach\" setting enabled if you are using profile to launch edizon se )\\nDetach GDB from game (method will depend on GDB client) and reattach dmnt with ZL+B to have access to CheatVM again.\\n\\nAdded ASCII display to memory explorer. Added bit mask for single value search.\\n\\nUse dmp0 and allow button swap for jump back. Jump back data will be using dmp0 so it won't overwrite dump file meant for pointer search. If you don't understand what this means don't worry, it has no impact to you.\\n\\nWhen all cheats are deleted edizon se will exit instead of crash.\\n\\n3.8.24\\n\\nWith atmosphere 20 you can press ZL+B to ask dmnt to detach from the game. There very few games that does not work well with dmnt attached but if you happen to be playing those games you can ask dmnt to detach when you are done using it to hack the game. ( Remember to turn off auto attach or the next time edizon se launch dmnt will be attached ).\\n\\nWith atmosphere 20 it is now possible to support dynamic loading of master code. Now when you place a cheat file containing master code in edizon\\cheats it will be loaded correctly when you launch edizon se.\\n\\n3.8.20\\n\\nValue pair search can be activated by pressing + twice on search memory value tab. [ A,B ] indicates that you are in value pair mode.\\nQuite often some values are next to each other, for example HP and HP MAX or MP and MP MAX are very frequently next to each other.\\nIn this mode the two value you enter at this screen will be match with memory locations that has these two value next to each other.\\nLet's say you see your HP as 12/21 you may want to try searching for 12, 21 or 21, 12.\\n\\n3.8.17\\n\\nSysmodule manager will offer to help create system_settings.ini if there isn't one.\\n\\n3.8.16\\n\\nMany users have too many sysmodules running causing system stability problem for them.\\nThis version included sysmodule manager ported from hekate toolbox and extended to list all sysmodules including those without\\ntoolbox.json file, such sysmodule will be named according to the title id and mark as required reboot. You can edit the toolbox.json\\nfile created by EdiZon SE to get a better name and test the sysmodule to see if it really requires reboot.\\n\\nAdded two optional module in the zip. Now Noexs sysmodule and profile forwarder is included (they are disabled by default, use sysmodule manager to enable them).\\n\\nProfile forwarder let you launch edizon se using profile which saves a few seconds from needing to launch hbmenu.\\n\\nNoexs sysmodule let you do dump for PC pointer searching over wifi.\\n\\n3.8.15\\n\\nOpcode bounds check bug fix, mark search bug fix, clear search bug fix.\\n\\n3.8.14\\n\\nFix temporary expert mode enable cause crash when there was no cheats\\n\\n3.8.11\\n\\nChange LED behavior during memory search.\\n\\nSome games are using Alias instead of Heap. Now Alias is indicated in the main display for these games for awareness.\\n\\nAlias is functionally the same as heap for memory search performed by EdiZon SE. However it is a different entity as far as SVC (Nintendo Switch's system calls) is concerned. Currently alias as a memory region is not supported in cheat code type 0, 1 and 5.\\n\\nAdding a memory relative to alias_extend.base as a code (ZL+A on a bookmark without pointer chain) won't work unless you use the attached forked dmnt (for 18.1 only).\\nThis fork added option for Alias to code type 0, 1 and 5.\\nM: Memory region to write to (0 = Main NSO, 1 = Heap, 2 = Alias).\\nChange request to have this in official dmnt is rejected. So use such code for own amusement only.\\n\\nI notice many new games are using alias recently but I have not found memory I want to hack that is static relative to alias_extend.base. At the moment it is just nice to be able to quickly bind memory hack to a key press for testing purpose. Static (relative to main, heap, alias) memory is rare, theoretically I see no reason why static relative to heap should be more common than static relative to alias. I think the need is real just not immediate.\\n\\n3.8.10\\n\\nNow no need to relaunch for new code to take effect. Code updates works immediately.\\n\\nIf you are developing code on a PC you can put your new [buildid].txt in \\switch\\edizon\\cheats for it to be loaded and ready for the game that is currently running.\\n\\nChange in P status display in memory explorer.\\nEach bit in P shows the potential to reach main in x back jump with offset no more than max P range.\\nbit0 9, bit1 8, bit2 7, bit3 6, bit4 5, bit5 4, bit6 3, bit7 2.\\n\\n3.8.09\\n\\nFor easy mode if cheat exist it will not be automatically overwritten when a different one is available in the database. To overwrite existing cheat press + key on the main screen.\\n\\nFixed a bug where cheat code file would be renamed to .old even when there isn't a cheat code available from cheat database when replacing cheat with file from database is enabled\\n\\nChanged the bit ordering of P (See release note of 3.8.08). It is now reversed for better run time efficiency in pointer search.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.8.04\\n\\nNow you can Rstick click on a memory in memory explorer to help setup multi target search for this memory target.\\n\\n3.7.24\\n\\nEasy mode for people who only want to use code created by others.\\nNo more confusing options and complex key combinations. For people who only want to use cheat codes you now have a\\nfull turn key solution from cheat code download to usage. Just enable the codes and enjoy.\\nPS: Do not enable expert option and it will be easy as pie.\\n\\n3.7.21\\n\\nBookmark added with \"+\" create an entry in BMDump.dat. This file will be use for bookmark import for newer version of pointersearcher SE.\\nThis change reduce potential clutter created by imported bookmarks. Having EdiZon SE running no longer block bookmark import.\\n\\nNeed to update pointersearcher SE to 0.5.9\\nNeed to update noexs sysmodule to 152\\n\\n3.7.18\\n\\nAdded short cut to set search mode. Now you can change mode and continue your search faster.\\nAdded option to use range on unknown search. Default. Set option for old behavior.\\nAdded option to freeze game while applet is activated. Not default. Set option to enable.\\nLimit to one search per session. More than one can cause problem, now it is disabled.\\nFix a bug that crash switch when \"Y\" is pressed when icon is blank.\\n\\n3.7.17\\n\\nFor Super Mario\u2122 3D All-Stars when one of the game is running the title id seen by cheat gui is not the same as the one use with game save. This cause the game save to not show up when last played game save is suppose to show up in earlier release.\\n\\nGame with unsupported save type ( for example Animal Crossing\u2122: New Horizons ) will be reported as not found with a different error message. Relaunching will display all game saves instead of staying at the not found screen.\\n\\nProvided option to opt for all game save to be displayed all the time. To enable create /switch/EdiZon/showallsaves.txt.\\n\\nPS: Showing only the save of last game cheat gui saw is intended feature. For user with many game saves showing all game saves makes locating the one being worked on a chore. I understand some user would prefer to see all game save and now you have that option.\\n\\n3.7.16\\n\\nI missed one file directory redirect in the code for unknown value search. This cause unknown value search to stuck if the data directory is not the default one.\\n\\n3.7.15\\n\\nfixed dark theme has no contrast in option screen selection\\n\\n3.7.14\\n\\nAdded clear all bookmark option.\\nImproved search mode help text.\\nImproved button hints.\\nChanged key to add bookmark to code.\\nDisplay search config on main screen.\\nAllow change of type for candidate display.\\n\\n3.7.13\\n\\nUpdate about screen to show latest release info.\\nAdded a button on config screen to go to about screen.\\nChanged config file name to seconfig so there won't be problem with older version\\n\\nsnapshot\\n\\nThis build could be unstable, you may install and use it at your own risk.\\nso 3.0.1 is still included in this release along side the snapshot update.\\n\\n3.0.1\\n\\nEdiZon has a new and beautiful icon by kardch!\\nFixed stack overflow when too many addresses were found\\nRenamed Edit RAM to Cheats\\n\\n3.0.0\\n\\nCheat engine like RAM editor!\\nFreezing of variables in RAM using dmnt:cht. Only works with Atmosph\u00e8re, not with other CFWs!\\nCheat management tool for Atmosph\u00e8re's dmnt:cht. Only works with Atmosph\u00e8re, not with other CFWs!\\nReimplemented the auto updater. This is a breaking change! You need to update to this release manually.\\n    Now updates configs, scripts AND cheats!\\nFixed and greatly improved the uploading of save files. You now get a code you can enter on http://edizon.werwolv.net . Thanks A LOT to @Ac_K for all his help!\\nLots of UI and touch bug fixes\\nFixed building being impossible except your were me\\nAdded progress bars to many long lasting operations\\n\\n2.2.0\\n\\nAdded proper touch scrolling to the main menu and part of the editor\\nAdded tool tips to widgets. Every widget can now have extra information attached to it\\nNavigation in the editor now only uses the joy sticks while modifying values uses the dpad.\\nAdd a way to display a message when loading a config\\nFixed button widgets not setting strArgs and intArgs properly thus being useless\\nFixed crash when trying to upload a batch backup\\nAdded a \"loading editor\" message to prevent EdiZon from looking frozen\\n\\n2.1.0\\n\\nAdded save file upload to https://transfer.sh! Special thanks to @StevenMattera for his server side script :)\\nAdded button widget that executes a function in the script file\\nAdded message boxes when updating EdiZon/configs and uploading a save file to avoid the switch looking locked up.\\nAdded more debug logs to help script creators\\n\\n\\n2.0.1\\n\\nFixed backups not being listed correctly when trying to restore them\\nFixed reversed Editable titles / All titles text in main menu\\nFixed menu scrolling with 10 titles\\n\\n1.7.0\\n\\nRemoved the old account selection and replaced it with the switch's user selection applet!\\nFixed icon rendering on the hbmenu\\nMade some animations prettier and cleaned up the UI a bit\\nFixed cancellation of batch backups still showing the keyboard\\nFixed some applet related memory leaks / corruptions that may have crashed other homebrew when launched afterwards\\nConfig developers: Added a comment widget that can display any text inside the editor\\nSwitched from using L and R to ZL and ZR for batch backups and editable-only titles in the menu\\n\\n1.6.0\\n\\nNaming of backups using the Switch's software keyboard!\\nEditing values by entering the value with the keyboard!\\nNew beautiful icon by @bernv3\\nLess biased SX OS warning message and fix for the false positive on ReiNX2.0\\nNew libnx 2.0.0 rendering code\\nFixed weird menu scrolling bug when less than 10 titles were displayed\\nFixed the laggy menu\\nEasier to understand error messages\\n\\n1.5.1\\n\\nMostly a bug fix release.\\n\\n##Full changelog\\n\\nCompiled with libnx 1.5.0 which fixes timestamps being 31121969_235959 when the switch hasn't been connected to the internet before and the timestamps being in UTC\\nFixed visual glitch when pressing the L button while selecting an account\\nFixed some more of the menu lag\\nPrevented useInstead from creating an infinite loop and freezing EdiZon\\nAdded a warning message for SX OS users since it still causes issues\\nCleaned up the code base and removed some more unnecessary debug prints\\nAdded all the lastest configs and scripts\\n1.5.0\\n\\n\\You can now backup all saves of a single game or the saves of all games and users at once from the title select screen. Thanks to @trueicecold for this feature\\nAdded editable-only mode which hides all games except the ones you can edit using the builtin save editor. Again thanks to @trueicecold for this.\\nAdded scrolling multipliers to the value widgets. Like that you can scroll in steps of 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000.\\nAdded a step size setting to the configs that acts as a multiplier for the multipliers.\\nFrom now on ALL configs get shown immediately without the need to approve them first. However, they get overlayed with a big 'BETA' label so you can see that they might not work yet.\\nAdded support for shared fonts. This makes the whole UI a lot prettier and makes the .nro a bit smaller. Thanks to @AnalogMan151\\nUpdated Lua to the latest version 5.3.5\\nCleaned up the entire UI\\nFixed a lot of lag everywhere\\nFixed issues with huge save files causing Lua to fail\\nFixed issue with the latest libnx\\nRefactored and cleaned up a lot of code and got rid of many many memory leaks\\nFixed equations.

            "details": "An overlay that with companion SaltyNX plugin NX-FPS allows to set custom FPS in Nintendo Switch retail games.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Tool is utilizing detection of graphics API to manipulate FPS and in special cases it requires using patches made per game for each version to get more than 30 FPS. You can find those patches HERE\\nMax supported yaml size is 32kB, though it can be expanded in next updates.\\n\\nRequirements:\\n* Atmosphere CFW\\n* My fork of SaltyNX, version 0.5.1+\\n* NX-FPS 1.1+\\n* Tesla environment: ovlloader + Tesla Menu\\n\\nOverlay runs in two modes:\\n\\n* When game is running\\n\\nIf game is supported by SaltyNX and you installed everything correctly, you will see menu where first line states NX-FPS plugin is running. Explanation of each line:\\n\\nInterval Mode - it's used by NVN API to set limiter to either 30 FPS (2) or 60 FPS (1 or 0 (0 means that game never bothered to set it, it can be also a sign that game is not utilizing NVN but EGL or Vulkan))\\nCustom FPS Target - it's used to lock game to certain FPS. If game is using engine proprietary FPS locks, it may not be able to unlock more than 30 FPS without additional patches.\\nBig number on the right - it shows how many frames have passed in last second for currently running game. This is to confirm that lock is working as expected.\\nIncrease/Decrease FPS target - Change FPS Target by 5. Minimum is 15 FPS, max is 60 FPS. If FPS is set above 30 FPS, it sets interval mode to 1. Otherwise it sets interval to 2.\\nDisable custom FPS target - Removes FPS Target. Since we cannot predict what interval mode is expected at this point, it is in user's discretion to manipulate FPS to bring back correct interval before disabling FPS target.\\nAdvanced settings - submenu which consists of:\\nSync Wait - this is dangerous setting that disabled in most cases will crash game (for example Witcher 3 and Breath of The Wild), but in some can bring benefit of disabling double buffer at the cost of small graphical glitches (for example Xenoblade Chronicles 3). Use it with caution.\\nConvert config to patch file - if proper config file exists for this game and version, you will get an option to convert it to patch file that will be loaded when you will run this game next time. Patch is saved to SaltySD/plugins/FPSLocker/patches/*titleid_uppercase*/*buildid_uppercase*.bin\\nDelete patch file - if proper config file exists for this game and version, you will get an option to delete patch file so it won't be loaded when you will run this game next time.\\nSave settings - save profile for currently running game that will be loaded next time by plugin on boot automatically. Don't use it if you disabled Sync Wait and you didn't test it properly that it won't cause crash. Profile is saved in SaltySD/plugins/FPSLocker/*titleid_uppercase*.dat\\n\\n* When game is not running:\\n\\nIt will list installed games (max 32) and as first option it's available \"All\" submenu.\\nInside each one you will find two options:\\n\\nDelete settings - it will delete file created by \"Save settings\" option\\nDelete patches - it will delete file created by \"Convert config to patch file\" option\\n\\nThanks to ~WerWolv for creating Tesla environment, and ~cucholix + ~Monked for tests.",
            "changelog": "v3.2.3\\n- Fixed an issue where running game with different program than main one resulted in no game version showing up in Advanced Settings\\n- Updated internal titleid base.\\n\\nv3.2.2\\n- Fix 0x207 error showing up for some people\\n  - It was a combination of using nx-ovlloader in 4MB mode and overlay using too big socket buffers which I increased recently when debugging some other errors, which resulted in socket buffers taking 4x more space.\\n- Update internal titleid base.\\n\\nv3.2.1\\n- Fix an issue with game specific \"Delete settings\" option not deleting settings for different programs than main one (limited to first 16 IDs).\\n- Update internal titleid base.\\n\\nv3.2.0\\n- Add an alternative source \"Gitee\" for downloading FPSLocker configs that is not blocked by China and other countries that block Github/are blocked by Github. I used it as first source because it's universally available, though it may be a bit slower to use for people located further from China.\\n  - Big thanks to sskyNS: https://github.com/sskyNS for hosting automated clone repository on Gitee (because it requires Chinese phone number to create repository).\\n  - So first is checked Gitee, if config was not found it checks readme on gitee. If game or its version was not found in readme on Gitee, it moves to github to check for config and if not found, it checks readme on Github.\\n- Now you can exit Advanced settings even in the middle of Check/Download config file connection, session will be terminated before going back to main menu.\\n- When config file is not found in Warehouse, percentage indicator will show up when downloading README.\\n- Change license to GPLv2 to comply with libtesla.\\n- Update internal titleid base.\\n\\nv3.1.1\\n- Games list titles now load faster by 35% on average on FW 19.0.0+\\n  - Found a different way to retrieve titles which is faster than original function. Added PR to libnx so other people can use it.\\n- If you are using old enough SaltyNX for BID to show only zeroes, Check/Download config file will instantly time out.\\n- Updated internal titleid base.\\n- Updated Chinese Simplified translation. Thanks to @naicfeng https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker/pull/80\\n\\nv3.1.0\\n- Added compatibility for Atmosphere 1.10.0+ \\n  - Older SaltyNX releases can have random issues when using with Atmosphere 1.10.0 and newer. \\n  - This release is backwards compatible so you can use it with older Atmosphere too.\\n  - It is required to update to SaltyNX 1.6.0+ for the same reason!\\n- When using Check/Download config file and when config file was not found, but it was confirmed that game is listed in Warehouse with different version, now newest supported update is printed.\\n- Updated internal titleid base\\n\\nv3.0.6\\n- When using the Check/Download config file, information will be sent to my own tracker. This will provide a clearer view of what people would like to be available in the Warehouse. No personal data or hardware data is sent.\\n  - To avoid introducing a visibly worse experience when using the Check/Download config file, I set the connection to terminate if it takes longer than 1 second.\\n- Updated internal titleid base\\n\\nv3.0.5\\n- Now if game has no config available on sdcard, in Advanced settings below provided TID and BID you will see also game versions:\\n  - Developer game version | Internal game version's major value / Raw internal game version\\n- Updated internal titleid base\\n\\nEDIT 08.11.2025 08:08 GMT: Added check that without it can lead to some random issues for games without update installed.\\n\\nv3.0.4\\n- Fix Halt unfocused game state not being saved in certain situations.\\n- Update internal titleid base.\\n\\nv3.0.3\\nFix config to patch conversion in scenario where MASTER_WRITE's asm_a64 type included BL instruction with direct offset (this fixes an issue with config for Kirby's Dream Buffet)\\n\\nv3.0.2\\n- Multiple fixes in FPSLocker config to patch conversion related to assembly instructions (no config was affected by it as of 17.10.2025, but this was hindering slightly process of writing them)\\n  - LDRB and LDRH now don't return error when instruction has provided fixed offset\\n  - TBZ and TBNZ now support goto labels\\n  - All condiitonal branches are now supported\\n- Updated titleid base to match current day status\\n\\nv3.0.1\\nAdd support for SaltyNX 1.5.2 new feature which allows changing buffering in real time in supported NVN games (if game is not compatible with that real time feature, in Set Buffering menu you will see notice \"It will be applied on next game boot\").\\n  - Remember that some games are designed in the way where you won't see the difference in FPS between double and triple buffer, usually that's a result of missing some NVN calls - example of such game is The Hundred Line.\\n\\n Updating to SaltyNX 1.5.2+ is required!\\n\\nv3.0.0\\n- Add support for next generation of FPSLocker configs called \"v4\"\\n  - Allows putting code caves and new variables inside SaltyNX Core, which allows easier updating of more complex configs + helps avoiding conflicts with cheats using caves\\n  - More functionality when using branches in assembly\\n  - \"v3\" branch in FPSLocker Warehouse is now removed, and \"v3.1\" branch will be removed in next week.\\n- User is now informed in main menu with red text \"Patch file was not found\" when currently running game is known that it should use FPSLocker patch but FPSLocker didn't detect it.\\n\\n Updating SaltyNX to 1.5.0+ version is required!\\n\\nEdit 07.09.2025 22:26 GMT: Fixed an issue with links to addons and Warehouse README.\\nEdit 08.09.2025 17:28 GMT: Forgot to make unsafeCheck \"true\" by default.\\n\\nv2.4.0\\n- Add support for FPSLocker configs utilizing \"asm_a64\" in MASTER_WRITE. It allows writing human readable assembly instead of using big endian integers like it was before\\n- Switch to new branch v3.1 in Warehouse which will support this new type of writing assembly, v3 branch which was used in previous FPSLocker versions is now deprecated and will be removed in 1-2 months.\\n\\nThis doesn't bring any new functionality to users, but not updating FPSLocker to newest version can eventually result in not having access to Warehouse directly from overlay, so update is recommended for everybody.\\n\\nv2.3.1\\nAdd option \"60 Hz in HOME Menu\" in Display settings and Docked Settings->Additional Settings. More in README. \\n\\nRequires SaltyNX 1.4.3+ to work properly!\\n\\nv2.3.0\\nRequires SaltyNX 1.4.0+ to work properly\\n\\n- Removed save settings option, now every change is automatically saved\\n- Fixed bugged Display Sync Docked functionality\\n- Fix issue with both Wizards, being initiated, not returning to 60 Hz after pressing B\\n- Separate display overclocking settings for docked 720p\\n- Separate FPS targets saved for docked and handheld\\n- Hide Docked Settings options that were blocked (because of not being in docked mode or not using 720p/1080p modes)\\n- FPSLocker now is closed faster when game is running\\n\\nv2.2.1\\nSeparate Display Sync for handheld and docked\\n\\nv2.2.0-release\\n- Add support for 720p/1080p docked mode refresh rates: 70, 72, 75, 80, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120 Hz (Requires SaltyNX 1.3.0: https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX/releases/tag/1.3.0-release)\\n  - Add wizard for testing refresh rates from 70 up to 120 Hz for 1080p (for 720p it automatically unlocks all refresh rates supported by your display)\\n  - Not all displays supporting 1080p signal with refresh rates higher than 75 Hz can be set to those higher refresh rates, more in README.\\n\\n- Add support for changing refresh rates for Switch OLED and Retro Remake OLED displays. (Requires SaltyNX 1.3.0: https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX/releases/tag/1.3.0-release)\\n  - For Switch OLED it comes with auto gamma curve adjustments on hardware level that are trying to reproduce original colors as close as possible, but because of nature of such approach it's not possible to do it perfectly (the worst case is at 60% brightness using 45 Hz). With that also comes another issue, the lower the refresh rate the lower max brightness.\\n  - For Retro Remake SUPER5 first revision users, you must enable Retro Remake Mode in Display Settings. That is because we can't differentiate between first SUPER5 and already existing InnoLux display. That option won't show up for other users.\\n\\n- Load game titles in background, resulting in faster boot times when game is not running\\n- Add support for languages: German, French, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Simplified (UI was redesigned to give them more space for text), it's set based on system language. You can force back English if you prefer.\\n\\n2.1.6\\nFix an issue with some capture cards triggering segfault when trying to access Docked settings because they store VIC index 0 which is invalid (f.e. NZXT Signal HD60, EVGA XR1 Lite)\\n\\n2.1.5\\nStore Docked settings in ini file instead of EDID dump (this is a needed step to introduce proper docked display overclocking in future)\\nUse SaltyNX 1.2.6+ for proper support\\nPrint your display's config name in Docked settings\\nFor people that would want to know which config is which when exploring files, I added key \"tvName\", its value can be edited and it will be maintained. Don't use spaces, those will be removed next time you change settings\\n\\n2.1.4\\nImprove \"Reported max refresh rate\" readings in Docked display settings.\\n\\n2.1.3\\nAdd \"Halt unfocused game\" in Advanced Settings (to work properly it requires SaltyNX 1.2.5+).\\nSome games are not suspended when your Switch is in Home Menu (for example Tales of Graces f). Enabling this option moves thread responsible for pushing frames to display into infinite loop when you are in Home Menu. Enabling this option can cause various issues depending on game, so be sure to not use it frivolously.\\n\\n2.1.2\\nAdd support for changing amount of buffers in Vulkan games (requires SaltyNX 1.2.3+)Fix an issue where at unstable internet connection checking Warehouse for info about patch takes 20-30 seconds instead of few seconds.\\n\\n2.1.1\\nAdd support for SaltyNX 1.2.1+\\nAdded support for converting configs to new type of patches currently supported by SaltyNX. You must convert every config again to be compatible with SaltyNX 1.2.1 and newer. That's to futureproof support for OCing displays to 60+ Hz.\\nNow disabling \"Allow patches to force 60Hz\" in Docked Settings -> Additional settings also disables 4 second delay before cutscenes when playing in docked mode with patch that has such thing available, f.e. Yakuza and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, 3, X.",

Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre.\\n\\nRather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of this project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from the common, reusable code.\\n\\nThe Flare engine, which is purely a runtime, is written in C++.\\n\\nFlare uses simple file formats (INI-style config files) for most of the game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats are preferred (png, ogg). For creating maps, we also support Tiled with the Flare plugin.\\n\\nOriginally the first game to be developed using this engine was part of this repository. As the engine became mature, the game content was moved to an extra repository and is now called flare-game. (happened around sept. 2012)"

            "details": "Easy-to-use title installer & manager for Nintendo Switch\\n\\nIf you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.\\nBrief description\\nGoldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing,\\n\\nYou can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.\\n\\nIf you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nInstalling NSP packages can be dangerous.\\n\\nKeep in mind that there will always be a ban risk, and that NSPs with tickets are specially dangerous.\\n\\nIf you want to be safe, avoid connecting to the internet via airplane mode, or block Nintendo's services via special tools such as 90DNS.\\n\\nGoldleaf simply provides support for a normal NSP and/or ticket installation. The way you use them or the risks you are taking are your problem.\\n\\nGoldleaf gives the user the possibility to modify NAND files, by deleting them or allowing to copy new files there.\\n\\nThis can be dangerous, as deleting NCAs from the NAND contents can lead to unfixable errors. Image deleting all the EXE and DLL files from System32 folder. Well, the result would be similar.\\n\\nRemoving tickets from installed contents will make the system not to be able to recognise them as \"legit\" purchased, so it will refuse to launch them (in many cases, but NOT all cases)\\n\\nMain features\\nSD card and NAND browser\\n\\nA very simple but, in my opinion, one of the most useful features in Goldleaf. Just a file browser for the SD card or for NAND partitions, providing special support for some file formats:\\n\\nNSP (Nintendo Submission Package)\\n\\nIt's the official format used by Nintendo to provide installable content from their CDN servers.\\n\\nTechnically, it's a PFS0 (a simple file format containing several files) with NCA contents, sometimes XML and/or icon metadata (exported by official packaging tools), and a ticket and a cert in case they are signed with a titlekey (games are, system contents aren't).\\n\\nGoldleaf can install NSPs same way other official apps would, like DevMenu.\\n\\nAs a warning, I do not recommend installing NSPs in case you plan to go online. Installing content from unofficial tools (such as Goldleaf or the old Tinfoil) can lead to permanent bans from online services, and in severe cases, from every Nintendo service, even from updating the console or games. Install NSPs at your own risk.\\n\\nNRO (Nintendo Relocatable Object)\\n\\nOfficially is treated as a dynamic library object, similar to DLLs on Windows. This are loaded dynamically by applications at runtime.\\n\\nHomebrew uses them as executable binaries because as they can contain multiple data sections, we can use them to load extra info such as NACP (title, author and version), an icon, or even RomFs data to access at runtime.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability of launching NROs located at the SD card. Keep in mind that this feature usually can cause undefined behavior due to some difficulties cleaning up graphics so quickly.\\n\\nNCA (Nintendo Content Archive)\\n\\nThis format is the base format used by Horizon OS to store content.\\n\\nWhile the previously mentioned formats don't require any kind of cryptography to be extracted or used, NCAs have to be decrypted, so the user is required to provide the required keys to extract the content.\\n\\nNCAs have different sections, as well as other information. The two main sections are the ExeFs and RomFs: the ExeFs filesystem contains the code NSO binaries and a NPDM metadata file, while the RomFs contains different files to be accessed from the title.\\n\\nSome NCAs could also contain a special section, which is the section 0. This section contains the PNG and GIF logos displayed at the top-left and botton-right of the console when launching a title.\\n\\nNCAs don't have neccessarily those two sections. The program NCA, the base of any application or applet, will contain an ExeFs, and usually a RomFs in case it's a game or a system title with resources like settings or Home Menu.\\n\\nAppart from program NCAs there are some other NCA types: control NCA (NACP and icons), legalinfo NCA (HTML manuals and information), offline NCA (HTML documents in case the title wants to load them) content meta CNMT NCA (with title specific information)...\\n\\nGoldleaf has embedded hactool in his code, so it can extract those partitions from NCAs, if the keys are provided.\\n\\nNXTheme (Home Menu theme)\\n\\nThis format is developed by Qcean team, a format to handle Home Menu layout modding.\\n\\n+Goldleaf can install them, but it needs to have Home Menu's RomFs at sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch. If the keys used with other formats are provided, Goldleaf itself will locate the console's qlaunch and extract it to that directory.\\n\\nYou will have to reboot with CFW after installing a theme to see any changes.\\n\\nNACP (Nintendo Application Control Property)\\n\\nThis is the format used by Nintendo to store a title's name, version, author name and other information, like if the title supports screnshots or video captures.\\n\\nGoldleaf can parse a NACP file and display some of it's information.\\n\\nTickets and certificates\\n\\nTickets (.tik) and certificates (.cert) are the format used by Nintendo to provide encryption data for titlekey-signed titles (almost every game).\\n\\nNSPs usually contain them, and Goldleaf can install them if they are located in the SD card.\\n\\nTo install a ticket you will have to provide a certificate, both with the same name and in the same directory, with their extension. (example: sd:/game.tik and sd:/game.cert)\\n\\nThe NAND browser has almost the same support, but it's reccomended to use it only to export files via copying them to the SD card, to avoid any trouble. Goldleaf should warn when doing dangerous operations anyway.\\n\\nUSB installer and Goldtree\\n\\nYou can install NSPs via USB using Goldtree, a C# PC client to handle this installations.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB installations are a bit unstable, and might bug sometimes.\\n\\nTitle manager\\n\\nGoldleaf's title manager will display all the titles installed in the system, both SD, NAND and the one in the gamecart if inserted.\\n\\nYou can view these titles' information, icon, install location and Application Id.\\n\\nTitles can also be completely uninstalled here. Keep in mind that deleting a title won't delete its savedata, that should stay on the system.\\n\\nTicket manager\\n\\nGoldleaf can get all the tickets installed on the console. While some of them will contain the name of the title they belong to, some could belong to DLC or other types of content despite not belonging directly to a title.\\n\\nYou can view the Application Id and the key generation of a ticket by selecting it.\\n\\nTickets can also be removed from the console. Removing tickets can be a dangerous option, as without them, titlekey-signed won't be allowed to boot by Home Menu.\\n\\nCFW configuration\\n\\nThis is mostly a useful menu for checking which CFWs are in the SD card and whichof them have any Home Menu modifications, meaning that a theme is probably installed there.\\n\\nYou can delete any Home Menu modifications of a certain CFW after selecting a CFW.\\n\\nConsole information\\n\\nOn this option, you can check the used size of the SD card, the entire NAND, and on the different NAND partitions.\\n\\nIt also displays the current firmware version the console is.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nDisplays Goldleaf's logo and whether Goldleaf is running as a NRO from hbmenu or as a normal title.\\n\\nAs some other miscellaneous options, you can easily reboot or shut down your console from Goldleaf, by pressing ZL or ZR in any moment.\\n\\nProviding keys\\nIf you provide a file with several Switch keys (commonly named as prod.keys or keys.dat) you will be able to do some extra stuff with Goldleaf: (remember that you have to place it as sd:/goldleaf/keys.dat)\\n\\nUnless you already have dumped qlaunch's (aka Home Menu) RomFs (or at least the files within lyt folder) in sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch directory, you will need to provide the previously mentioned key file with several keys, so that Goldleaf can extract directly the RomFs of the console's qlaunch contents to use it.\\n\\nYou have the option to extract NCA contents (ExeFs, RomFs or section 0), but you will need the previously mentioned keys too.\\n\\nGoldtree and USB installs\\nUSB communication is slightly different from Tinfoil's one, so Tinfoil's old Python script, AluminumFoil nor other tools won't work properly.\\n\\nGoldtree will ask you to choose a NSP after establishing connection with Goldleaf, and it will be received and installed by Goldleaf.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB support is a bit unstable, and sometimes it might fail. Anyway, it should work most of the times.\\n\\nBasic controls\\nThe controls are quite intuitive in Goldleaf, but here you have a brief explanation of them:\\n\\nPress A to select options from menus, browse folders, or in case it's a file, to browse a menu with file options (copy, delete...)\\n\\nPress B to cancel a dialog or to go back to the previous page / menu.\\n\\nPress X to paste the path of the clipboard. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress Y to browse a menu with directory options, similar to the one used with files, instead of browsing the directory. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress ZL or ZR anywhere to browse a menu with reboot / shut down options, in case you want to reboot or shut down the console.\\n\\nPress Plus (+) or Minus (-) to exit Goldleaf and return to hbmenu. This option is only available if Goldleaf is loaded as a NRO binary. (more special cases like this one below)\\n\\nMovement is quite obvious. Using the L-stick, the R-stick or the D-pad you can move through menu or dialog options. On menus (like the file browsers or the main menu) the R-stick provides a way faster scrolling.\\n\\nSpecial features\\nGoldleaf differs on some features depending on whether it is loaded as a NRO or as an installed title:\\n\\nGoldleaf can be exited via Plus (+) or Minus (-) buttons if it's loaded as a NRO, but as regular titles have to be exited from the Home Menu, this feature is not available as a title.\\n\\nGoldleaf disables Home button pressing while installing a NSP if it's loaded as a title, but this feature isn't available as a NRO binary for technical reasons related to applets.\\n\\nGoldleaf cannot launch NRO binaries if it's loaded as a title due to technical reasons. They can only be launched from another NRO binary.\\n\\nIssues and support\\nIn case you find a bug or you need help with Goldleaf, you have several places to ask.\\n\\nMany errors are very common and can be misunderstood, and you should document a bit for some errors instead of directly calling them issues:\\n\\nIt's a common issue for some NSPs, although they are completely valid ones, being detected as wrong NSPs. Although they can be really wrong NSPs, it is usually caused by firmware mismatch. For instance, in case you are trying to install a title which requires at least 5.1.0 version (which uses key generation 4) on a lower firmware version, it won't be recognised as a valid NSP for cryptographical reasons. (the console cannot decrypt the NSP because it is encrypted with unknown keys which are within 5.1.0 update)\\n\\nThe USB installation can sometimes freeze in the middle of the install.

Various relevant UI changes come in this release:\\n\\nThe color scheme is no longer randomly generated at startup: there is now a default blue light/dark color scheme (although you can still customize it yourself) along with the project's gold color\\n\\nNew icons are used everywhere (since I had to find new ones that had good resolutions)\\n\\nGoldleaf's settings have (slightly) changed: setting names are (slightly) different now, and the color customization is done in a more organized way (check the README for all details)\\n\\nThe memory/space menu has been reorganized, taking up space in a more visually appealing way\\n\\nToo-long texts are clamped now, so that they don't protrude outside their expected bounds\\n\\nNow directory sizes are only computed if a setting (disabled by default) is enabled, since it lead to slowdowns when selecting large directories for other purposes.\\n\\nWhen exporting/dumping contents, names containing invalid FS characters (\":\", \"/\" or \"\") are now replaced to avoid issues when creating the exported NSP.\\n\\nRemoved the old crash handling system, which worked half the time and made things annoying: crashes are handled like regular homebrew (with the usual system crash-screen), and detailed information about what caused the crash is logged in Goldleaf's log file\\n\\nIcons are now internally shared resources (previously, for each menu item/place it was used, a new icon copy was loaded in memory), which should reduce the memory footprint and somewhat improve performance\\n\\nAdded confirmation dialogs to the power-off/reboot dialog, to avoid unwanted ZL/ZR presses causing unwanted shutdowns/reboots\\n\\nUsing the web browser is no longer allowed unless Goldleaf is launched as an application (since otherwise it won't work and just cause a crash)\\n\\nFolders have now two different icons, visually distinguishing between empty and non-empty directories\\n\\nFixed a bug where the message after exporting ticket/cert was not shown at all (an empty, long box was only displayed)\\n\\nThe \"image\" menu icon is now shown also for PNG/WEBP images (even though they cannot be set as user icons)\\n\\nUpdated key generation recognition up to the latest 20.0.0/20.0.1 firmwares\\n\\nFor used tickets, the game title is displayed instead of the application ID on the ticket menu items (the ID can still be viewed by selecting a given ticket)\\n\\nAdded special handling when removing an account that is also linked (removing requires it to be unlinked first, this is now done automatically)\\n\\nAdded special result description messages for dedicated result codes (those with no previous description, or those where the base description was not really informative to users)\\n\\nFixed ETA calculation when copying directories (which would display nonsense when copying multiple small files) so that it displays somewhat coherent values\\n\\nThe user icon is exported again after changing it\\n\\nA bug was fixed where logging wouldn't happen correctly in certain menus\\n\\nMounted filesystems are now properly disposed when exiting Goldleaf\\n\\nPressing Y when a file is focused in the file browser will also display its options (like pressing A, so Y results in the same behaviour for files and directories)\\n\\nThe previous content system has been completely replaced by a brand-new game list menu:\\n\\nThis no longer considers/lists NAND-System contents, as that was a mostly useless (and slow) feature\\n\\nSlowness when loading contents has been reduced by using lazy-loading threaded code and caching many things\\n\\nGames and their contents are directly browsed now, instead of having to choose storages\\n\\nUseful information for debugging/dev purposes is displayed now as well (last record event and view flags)\\n\\nSize computing is more simple and straightforward now\\n\\nSave data mounting was fixed for games which use device savedata instead of per-user savedata (like Animal Crossing: New Horizons)\\n\\nIf no user was yet selected, trying to mount the save data will directly prompt to select a user, and mount it if succeeded\\n\\nThe tickets menu was moved to the main menu\\n\\nThe update menu was merged with the about menu: you can now check updates by pressing A on the about page\\n\\nFixed a dump replace-all bug where english strings would say \"g_Clipboard\" instead of \"clipboard\"\\n\\nTicket information now also shows the key generation version range (not only on NSP installation info)\\n\\nEmpty *.bin files can no longer be launched (or rather, Goldleaf attempting to launch them)\\n\\nMade transitions and movement in menus slightly faster (for convenience) and with more icons/dedicated messages for each menu\\n\\nThe text viewer was slightly improved, allowing to also displace horizontally to read long lines, and only rendering the visible part of each line",

Adjust it accordingly to fix the bug and to select auto dst.\\n- Joycon as PC HID Gamepad improved\\n It now allows OS to control the report rate in order for OS driver to not cause a pipe fail or congestion\\n It's also possible for Host now to manually request input reports\\n- SD Card Info now shows warning if vendor of SD is fake\\n- All battery and power management ICs in Battery Info are now checked for communication errors and if the version matches.\\n In case one of them can't be reached an Error! message will show up.\\n- Several UX issues were fixed on various backup/restore tools\\n Fixed verification % and bar if restored backup is smaller than partition\\n Bar is now orange for restoring when writing to eMMC/emuMMC.\\n Fixed bar color on restoring after verification\\n Allow verification to be skipped for all parts in partial mode (FAT32 or small card) automatically after the first skip\\n Corrected several warnings where it would refer to eMMC instead of emuMMC\\n- HW Info will now say when SBK/DK is locked and can't be read, instead of showing FF.\\n- SDMMC errors now update automatically after running SD benchmark to avoid reentering SD Card Info to check them\\n- bpmpclock is now extended from 3 to 5 modes. 4 being the slowest boost and 5 being the stock clock.\\n- Various fixes and improvements\\n\\n\\n\\nBDK changes\\n-\\n- DIRLIST: dirlist function was revamped and it now uses flags for options that also allow ASCII/Aa-Zz ordering selection.\\n- INI: Restored ASCII ordering for ini_parse when reading .ini files\\n- SMMU: Ability to disable smmu was added\\n- USB: Removed unused endpoints from descriptors and adjusted driver to not expect them\\n- USB: HID: Idle rate support was added for HID gadgets so badly coded OS drivers do not cause a pipe fail\\n- USB: HID: Get report support was added in case host wants to pull a report manually\\n- RAMDISK: Size was extended 1280 MB via reordering memory mapping\\n- FatFS: mkfs was improved further in order to optimize filesystem performance even more\\n- FatFS: PrFILE2: Fixed an issue on mkfs that would not allow PrFILE2 to create a SAFE record\\n- RTC: Fixed an off-by-one calculation for Month that affects also day and time because of conversion calculations.\\n- RTC: Added DST support\\n- PMC: pmc_enable_partition was renamed to pmc_domain_pwrgate_set\\n- FUSE: Added a fuse sense function\\n- HWINIT: Fix RAM_SVOP_PDP set for good \\n- HWINIT: Refactored T210 bootloader MBIST WAR\\n- Tegra: Added BIT/BCT headers for T210 and T210B01\\n- Minerva: Updated to v1.5\\n- Various fixes and improvements\\n\\n\\nFAQ\\n-\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>Click to expand FAQ notes</summary>\\n\\n- Which Linux/Android distributions are supported in Partition Manager?\\n For L4T Linux you can use the official Ubuntu Bionic 3.4.0 and newer or any other supported distro.\\n For android you can get Android 10/11 (legacy) or 13/14 (dynamic) or newer.\\n\\n- I don't care about emuMMC/Linux/Android. Can the Part manager be used for something else?\\n Yes. You can still reformat your SD card to a single FAT32 partition.\\n You can even use it when you have exFAT and you want to format to FAT32.\\n It is also suggested to format your sd card via hekate.

Coming soon is blacklisting folders in the scan, checking for and updating app store apps, and more.\\n\\nWhy does it exist? \\nTwo main reasons: I've contributed some code to the official hbmenu, but I wanted to try making something totally original for practice working with Switch dev tools. Also, I wanted a new and modern way to do the above current and future features, but there wasn't really a centralized app with a pretty GUI that accomplished all of that."

Controller Adaptation\\n- Completely solved the bug where playing macros with joycon and pro controller may cause the joystick to freeze\\n- Added a switch in JoyCon to toggle rapid fire for the left or right controller\\n\\n Macro Store\\n- Added macro store function, one-click download macros to switch\\n- In the store, you can directly see macro related introduction, such as author, usage instructions\\n- Accessing the store in-game will directly return the macros for that game\\n- Accessing the store when no game is running will directly return all installed game macros\\n- This is a community-based store, so the number of macros is temporarily very few\\n- Related servers have been set up in China, due to network restrictions, only domestic network can directly upload their own macros\\n- This upload function will be online in the next version\\n- Users in other regions can submit PR to my macro repository, or directly send macros to me\\n- In the future, macros on the Chinese server will also be regularly copied to the github repository\\n\\n Macro Detail Interface\\n- Added macro metadata file, macros downloaded from the store will directly display Simplified/Traditional/English names\\n- Macros downloaded from the store can view related usage instructions in the macro detail interface\\n- The shortcut setting interface added single play, loop play, interrupt play prompt texts\\n- Fixed the issue when renaming macro files, duplicate file was not handled\\n\\n Macro Editor\\n- Now when you save editor content, it will back up the original file, can be used to restore when modification goes wrong\\n- Rewrote editor data processing code, now processing of macro file data will be more accurate\\n- Editor added copy forward/backward, move forward/backward, modify joystick, delete joystick and other editing functions\\n- Note, modifying joystick changes the original coordinate full data joystick to virtual direction joystick, which will greatly reduce joystick precision\\n- Reset action and modify time functions now support batch operation\\n- Modify time function save button changed from A to +\\n- Now the action list will not be automatically merged after user modification\\n- Now when saving macros in editor, will not automatically add no-action at the end\\n- Fixed the issue of timeline total length drawing exception when total macro time changes\\n- Fixed the issue that undo button outside of Chinese does not automatically highlight\\n\\n Macro Recording\\n- Now after recording is completed, the no-action frames at the end of macro data will be automatically deleted\\n\\n Macro List\\n- Now when the number of macros in the game directory is 0, it will no longer be displayed in the list\\n- Added text showing the number of macros owned to the right of the game name list item\\n\\n Macro Playback\\n- Now, when playing a macro that contains joystick data, user inputs will not be applied to the joystick\\n- This change is to solve the problem that playing macros may cause joystick freezing\\n- And macros with joystick data themselves should not receive additional user input\\n\\n Others\\n- Added German support, thanks to @HeikesFootSlave for providing German translation text\\n- Now when opening ovl plugin, it will automatically detect whether there is a new version, if so, the update button will highlight to remind\\n- libultrahand library updated to the latest version\\n- Fixed curl resource leak issue\\n- Fixed the issue that when the network is poor in the update interface, exiting will block for a period of time\\n\\nFor versions 1.4.2 and later, you can directly update by pressing + in the settings interface\\nThe CN and EN versions differ only in the Tesla overlay title; everything else is identical.\\n\\n ZH\\n\\n \u624b\u67c4\u9002\u914d\\n-

The Auto Turbo and Auto Mapping switches apply only to Global configuration mode\\n- 2. When you launch a game, if the current configuration is Global, the system checks the Auto Turbo / Auto Mapping switches. If the switches are enabled, the corresponding features will be automatically turned on.\\n- 3. Note: These  Auto switches only take effect when launching a game and only in Global configuration mode.\\n- 4. When you launch a game, if the configuration is set to Per-game, the system decides whether features should auto-start based on their toggle states when you last exited that game.\\n- 5. For example, if Turbo was enabled in game A when you exited it, Turbo will automatically be enabled again the next time you launch game A.\\n\\nThe CN and EN versions differ only in the Tesla overlay title;

There was a lot of stuff here, i'm not going to list all of it as most of it was internal changes and bug-fixes anyway.\\nBy popular request this tool now recognizes some home-brew system modules and displays basic information about them. There is a google form available here If I've missed any popular modules. Keep in mind these descriptions only show up for layeredfs based modules. It is actually possible to pull this kind of information directly out of a KIP file.\\nUpdate NSWreleases.xml\\n\\n3.0.9\\n\\nFixed incorrectly displayed Atmosphere versions.\\nCenter the detail window header.\\nAdd a size limit to the detail window header so the text doesn't bleed off the screen.\\nRedo error.cpp/h to make adding new errors easier.\\nProperly throw a error if a non 200 HTTP response is received.\\nClarify curl errors.\\nFix reboot to Atmosphere code, it should no longer need to cause a console crash.\\nFixed quite a few spelling errors.\\n\\n3.0.8\\n\\nFixed the serious crashing bug in the short lived 3.0.7 release.\\nUsing some modified code from hactool Kip Select now pulls both the official kip name and titleid from the physical kip file.\\nNSWreleases.xml has been updated to the latest version.\\n\\n3.0.6\\n\\nIn Atmospheres latest release support for rebooting directly into a payload was added. This tool now leverages this in order to (almost) seamlessly restart back into Atmosphere. In the latest Atmosphere release a file called \"/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin\" was added, this file is pretty much a direct copy of fusse_launcher.bin and is necessary for this function to work. After triggering the restart the console will crash, this is normal, press volume up to continue the restart, this seems to be a problem with Atmosphere, as there official example program dose the same thing.\\nIn all Instances where the tool works with the SD card the proper prefix sdmc:/ has been added.\\nCleared up a few error descriptions, i'm probably going to end up completely refactoring this stuff again.\\nSome preparations have been made to support cfw's other than Atmosphere. Renix support should be trivial as it's built pretty much directly off of Atmosphere, keep a eye out for a beta release in the next few days if you are interested.\\n\\n3.0.5\\n\\nLFS now displays the name of most system titles!

The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills.

Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his fellow rabbits from slavery.\\n\\nHistory\\nLugaru was originally developed by David Rosen of Wolfire Games and was open sourced in 2010. It was made cross-platform with the help of Ryan C. Gordon.\\n\\nVarious forks were made at that time, and the most interesting developments were put back together under the OSS Lugaru organization, originally on Google Code and then on Bitbucket.\\n\\nThis new repository on GitLab is run by the same team, and aims at revitalizing the development effort to clean things up, ensuring the code base builds and runs fine on all supported platforms, and easing the packaging of Lugaru in Linux distributions.\\n\\nIdeally, the updated code base could also be used to update the Lugaru HD version sold by Wolfire Games once proven better than the current commercial builds.\\n\\nRun it through hbloader or hbmenu.nsp. Old Album method is not recommended (may cause crashes).\\nControls:\\nCheck in Options for current mapping. Press + to access menu (in-game).\\nNote that ZL and ZR are reserved for camera."

With the feedback of a few people who tested the beta builds and my testing of the most popular layouts on themezer i can say most themes should work fine with only minor UI differences.\\n\\nWe know of one specific layout that is currently broken on 20.0 and i expect a few more will pop up along the way, in those cases the layout author will have to manually fix it and provide a 20.0 compatible version.\\n\\nMaking 20.0 layouts\\n\\nIf you're making layouts and want to make sure they work on all fimware versions you should be careful to not move the applet icons around otherwise they will leave empty spots when the layout is installed on an older firmware, you can read more on the wiki.\\n\\nIf you made a 20.0 theme before this release you should diff your layout again with latest layout editor otherwise it might not show properly due to the auto fix mistaking it for an old layout.\\n\\nFinally, i'd like to thank @new-waifu, @ELY3M and @Migushthe2nd and the others on discord for the help in getting this release done and tested.\\n\\n4.7.1\\n\\nSupport for 17.0\\nExpose patch templates functionality in the PC theme injector, allows for patching custom szs files\\nMinor changes in bflan serialization, mostly for the layout editor",

It will be called at app's shutdown, and will be eventually populated with more deinitializing code, if needed in the future. For now it just contains the RomFS deinit call...\\n\\n0.2\\n\\nFixed a crash due to trying to load unexistent font file when no arc-files were found.",

Haven't tested with a pro controller, but would imagine it should work fine, as the fix specifically targets handheld mode. This means apart from finding slightly more natural gyro defaults for both handheld and wireless mode, the end user can enjoy seamless gyro controls between input methods.\\n\\nIf updating an older version, extract to the original folder and replace all files when prompted.\\n\\nv0.7.6 - Basic Gyro Support\\n\\nRewrote fgsfdsfgs's sdl_input_nx.c from ioquake3-nx to reference current HID refactor names, therefore enabling basic gyro support. (albeit technically incomplete due to no automatic switching of yaw axis to yaw/roll between controllers.)\\n\\nGyro can be enabled from the control settings in the main menu. The stock gyro configuration is meant for handheld use, so if you're using a pro/wireless controller you'll have to also type \"/in_gyromouse_yaw_axis 1\" (and if you want to go back to handheld type the last command with a 0 instead of 1).

Supaplex is a video game created by Philip Jespersen and Michael Stopp, two Swiss students, and published by Digital Integration in 1991. It is an extended clone of Boulder Dash.\\n\\nSupaplex introduces a number of new elements that were not present in Boulder Dash, including bugs, pieces of base that randomly cause a life-threatening electrostatic discharges, Ports, which limit Murphy's movement to specific directions, and terminals, which set off yellow Utility Disks. Utility Disks are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: Orange Disks work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, but not pulled (which allows creating Sokoban-like puzzles), and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.\\n\\nSupaplex is the first Boulder Dash-like game that is not fully grid-based: while the playing field is an obvious grid, the objects do not 'snap' from one grid position to another, but can be halfway or 'in between' grid positions while moving or falling. This behavior has led to a number of well-known bugs that can be turned to the player's advantage, many of which need to be exploited to complete fan-made levels. For instance, by turning around quickly, the player can cause an enemy or rock to 'bounce' off Murphy.\\n\\nThe game also applies 'gravity' on some levels, which means that Murphy will fall down empty spaces and will be unable to go back up, unless he climbs up by using bases. Gravity is not actually designated - the player can only notice via trial-and-error.\\n\\nControls:\\n- Up/Down/Left/Right: left joystick or directional pad\\n- Removing bases/infotrons next to Murphy: Y button + direction\\n- Detonate red disk: hold Y button\\n- Show/hide bottom game panel: X button\\n- Show number of red disks: A button\\n- Change game speed: L and R buttons\\n- Exit/back: - button\\n- Pause: + button"

It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.\\n\\nOpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0, but includes some 3rd party software under different licenses. See the section \"Licensing\" below for details.\\n\\n# Contacting\\nThe easiest way to contact the OpenTTD team is by submitting bug reports or posting comments in our forums. You can also chat with us on IRC (#openttd on irc.oftc.net).\\n\\nThe OpenTTD homepage is https://www.openttd.org.\\n\\nYou can also find the OpenTTD forums at https://www.tt-forums.net.\\n\\nThis is my Switch port of OpenTTD, a re-implementation of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.\\n\\nPort by @rsn8887, based on the Vita port by @angguss. I made some control enhancements and I also enabled sound on the Vita port, too (pull request to @angguss made).\\n\\n# Thanks\\n\\nThanks to the many developers who worked on this game.\\n\\nThanks to @angguss for his excellent Vita port, on which this Switch port is based.\\n\\nThanks to my supporters on Patreon: Andyways, CountDuckula, Greg Gibson, Jesse Harlin, \u00d6zg\u00fcr Karter, Matthew Machnee, and RadicalR.\\n\\n# Installation\\n\\nA public domain graphics set (OpenGFX) is included. If you want the choice to also use original dos game graphics, copy over the files\\n```\\nSAMPLE.CAT\\nTRHCOM.GRF\\nTREND.GRF\\nTRTITLE.GRF\\nTRG1.GRF\\nTRGC.GRF\\nTRGH.GRF\\nTRGI.GRF\\nTRGT.GRF\\n```\\nto `/switch/openttd/baseset/`\\n\\nIf the above files are present, a new option will appear when you go to game settings from the titlescreen. There you can select between the two graphics sets `original dos` and `openGFX`.\\n\\n# Controls\\n\\n- Left analog stick = mouse pointer control\\n- D-Pad or right analog stick = scrolling the map.\\n- A/right trigger = left mouse click\\n- B/left trigger = right mouse click\\n- Y = zoom-in\\n- X = zoom-out\\n- Double click A/right trigger over a text field = bring up on-screen keyboard\\n- The touch screen is used for indirect mouse input, like on a laptop touchpad. Move a single finger to move the mouse pointer. Use short tap for left click. Hold a single finger while tapping a second finger for right click. Drag with two fingers to drag and drop.\\n\\n# Current Limitations\\n\\n- No music (requires midi)\\n- No network support\\n"

In my experience this makes a few things look a bit better, might(?) smooth out performance, and futureproofs everything a touch (in case someone wanted to implement a newer renderer engine later down the line).\\n\\nIf upgrading from a previous build, all you need to replace is OpenArenaNX.nro / Q3ArenaNX.nro\\n\\nv0.7.7 - Better Gyro Support\\n\\nGyro now automatically detects whether the user's controller is in handheld or wireless mode and adjusts the axis accordingly. Haven't tested with a pro controller, but would imagine it should work fine, as the fix specifically targets handheld mode. This means apart from finding slightly more natural gyro defaults for both handheld and wireless mode, the end user can enjoy seamless gyro controls between input methods.\\n\\nIf updating an older version, extract to the original folder and replace all files when prompted.\\n\\nv0.7.6 - Basic Gyro Support\\n\\nRewrote fgsfdsfgs's sdl_input_nx.c from ioquake3-nx to reference current HID refactor names, therefore enabling basic gyro support. (albeit technically incomplete due to no automatic switching of yaw axis to yaw/roll between controllers.)\\n\\nGyro can be enabled from the control settings in the main menu. The stock gyro configuration is meant for handheld use, so if you're using a pro/wireless controller you'll have to also type \"/in_gyromouse_yaw_axis 1\" (and if you want to go back to handheld type the last command with a 0 instead of 1). Gyro speed can be adjusted by adjusting the mouse speed.",

Still ironing out why this happens, so be cautious.\\n- A small amount of slowdown can happen during really hectic battles in larger maps.\\n- If you switch between controller and keyboard + mouse input mid-match, your camera may start spinning wildly. Just press ESC/+, click with your desired input, then press ESC/+ again and it should resolve it. This might not even be a real bug and might just be my wireless keyboard, but I'm putting it here just to be safe."

Old replays will still play back fine.\\nINPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add option to skip deserializing checkpoints from replay files (it introduces jank in some emulators).\\nINPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add checkpoint and initial savestate compression, following the savestate_file_compression config boolean. Use zstd if available, or fall back to zlib.\\nINPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add incremental checkpoints based on statestreams (depending on HAVE_STATESTREAM compile time flag). As an example, 60 pcsx_rearmed savestates would take 267MB uncompressed; with incremental encoding this is reduced to 77MB. Compressing the result can reduce the size to just 4MB.\\nINPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Checkpoint compression and encoding can be combined. For example, 60 pcsx_rearmed checkpoints can take up just 15MB if each state is incremental and compressed. This is not as optimal as using incremental states without save state compression followed by offline compression, but is a good compromise in many use cases.\\nINPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add hotkeys and text commands to force a checkpoint insertion into the currently recording replay, and to seek backwards to the previous checkpoint and forwards to the next checkpoint.\\nINPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add a text command to seek to a specific frame of the currently playing/recording replay; it will return via the command replier the actual seeked-to frame (right now it only supports seeking to checkpoints).\\nINTL: Add Irish Gaelic to selectable languages\\nLIBRETRO: Deprecate intfstream_open_writable_memory\\nLIBRETRO: New environment function RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_TARGET_SAMPLE_RATE\\nMENU: Common Thumbnail Background option for all menu drivers\\nMENU: Move core options reset from Settings/Configuration to Main Menu / Configuration Files\\nMENU: Use right analog stick for thumbnail cycling in playlists\\nMENU: Option to always suggest cores, even when a core is already loaded\\nMENU: Option to show Favorites before History\\nMENU: Media history playlists are now visible in playlist manager\\nMENU: Import Content visibility defaults reverted\\nMENU: Update CRTSwitchRes menu options for future use\\nMENU: Debug builds are indicated in Information menu\\nMENU: Save As / Save Main options for configuration file\\nMENU: Unwanted input is prevented when menu is triggered by toggle combo\\nMENU: 32-bit values in cheats and rumble are not presented as huge lists\\nMENU: Less important widgets are now sized like task notifications\\nMENU: Play count is added to runtime log\\nMENU: Configurable startup page (several options beside default Main Menu)\\nMENU: Shader menu rework, combined save/remove menus, save current, Y and Start hotkeys for shader parameters and background opacity toggle\\nMENU: Single-click start option from playlists and Explore view\\nMENU: Allow kiosk mode and hiding of Settings menu also in GLUI and RGUI\\nMENU: Task widget improvements\\nMENU/GLUI: Show thumbnails in Explore view\\nMENU/XMB: Select button toggles thumbnails in playlists\\nMENU/XMB,OZONE: Fix content icons when playlist tabs are hidden\\nMENU/OZONE: Horizontal padding factor option\\nMENU/OZONE: Custom font selection and scaling factor\\nMENU/RGUI: Clock format is now configurable and moved to top header\\nNETPLAY: Push room info to lobby\\nNETWORK: Fixes for nmcli wifi driver\\nNETWORK: Network command interface enabled for Android, iOS, TVOS\\nOTHER: ZStandard support and libchdr update for support of chd files converted with createdvd option\\nOVERLAY: Speed limit on touch pointer tracking\\nOVERLAY: Dedicate each touch pointer to hitboxes or pointing devices\\nOVERLAY: Fix overlay turbo fire\\nPLAYLIST: Built-in playlists are now stored under playlists/builtin\\nPLAYLIST: Fix subsystem information in playlists\\nREPLAY: Bugs fixed regarding rewind\\nREPLAY: Same timeline check and future state check for replays vs. savestates\\nSAVESTATES: Savestate thumbnails are default enabled for x86_64 builds\\nSAVESTATES: Slot is now remembered using the runtime log file\\nSAVESTATES: Slot hotkey widget shows save state thumbnail\\nSCAN: Fix crash with Sega CD\\nSCAN: Log files without database match\\nSCAN: Optimization of database queries by content file size\\nVIDEO: Fix auto swap interval setup\\nVIDEO: Improvements for integer scale half scaling\\nVIDEO: Adjustments to smart integer scaling, considering title safe area\\nVIDEO: Frame delay improvements for the automatic setting\\nVIDEO: Auto-enable GPU recording with HW context cores\\nVIDEO: Fix viewport bias when using custom aspect ratio\\nVIDEO/D3D11/D3D12: snappy extra vsync presentation mode\\nVIDEO/GL: Fallback OpenGL symbol loader for Linux devices with EGL < 1.5\\nVIDEO/GL: Support for Cg and GLSL shaders in the GLCore video driver\\nVIDEO/GL: Improve GLES version detection\\nVIDEO/SHADER: Shader hold function, useful for some lightguns and shader comparison\\nVIDEO/SWITCHRES: Horizontal and vertical geometry adjustment options added\\nVIDEO/SWITCHRES: Game overrides\\nVIDEO/WAYLAND: Support for xdg-toplevel-icon-v1\\nVIDEO/WAYLAND: Fix deadlock when using Wayland Vulkan driver\\nVIDEO/WAYLAND: Fix fullscreen on auto monitor index (partial)",

Saints Row The Third)\\n  - Replaced a function pointer for reading file that is used when GlobalFileDataCache is enabled.\\n\\nv1.6.0\\n- Added compatibility for Atmosphere 1.10.0+ \\n  - Older SaltyNX releases can have random issues when using with Atmosphere 1.10.0 and newer. \\n  - This release is backwards compatible so you can use it with older Atmosphere too.\\n- Streamlined compiling Core and Bootstrap so 32-bit and 64-bit share now the same source code with few ifdefs\\n  - Because this is a big change, it may have introduced some bug I am not aware of\\n\\nv1.5.9\\n- Change method for retrieving focus of Application\\n  - It doesn't change anything in Core so perfect compatibility is maintained\\n  - Now CPU usage doesn't spike drastically while some games are running, causing sysmodule to be randomly unresponsive - if user decides to enable 60 HZ in HOME Menu in FPSLocker\\n\\nv1.5.8\\n- Remove exposing focus state\\n  - Was causing compatibility issues with some games like Super Mario Galaxy or Trails in the Sky 1st\\n  - \"60 Hz in HOME Menu\" from FPSLocker goes back to using old method\\n\\nv1.5.7\\nCheck focus state only when notification is received instead on every frame.\\n\\nv1.5.6\\n- Change method of how game's focus state is retrieved\\n  - This allows us to ditch old code for finding focus state of game, fixing an issue with rampaging CPU core in some games when they were out of focus IF user enabled \"60 Hz in HOME Menu\" option in FPSLocker\\n  - Now Core also exposes game's current focus state so other developers can use it (This doesn't inform if game was paused or not, this is solely retrieving its focus state - look at libnx AppletFocusState enum in applet.h for more informations)\\n- Change method of forcing game into pause (FPSLocker's Halt unfocused game), now Core only manages how game should handle focus state, leaving to kernel maintaining game in pause state which should have better compatibility than previous method\\n\\nv1.5.5\\nStop reporting resolutions that have height higher than 1440 pixels.\\n\\nv1.5.4\\n- Add support for reading resolutions from nvnCommandBufferSetScissor and nvnCommandBufferSetScissors, resolutions are pushed as Viewport. Any resolution passed to Scissor is ignored that was the same as last resolution pushed to Viewport. This fixes an issue with reading resolution in games on Pokemon Engine which are using Scissors for dynamic resolution.\\n- Core32 now is using hard float ABI, making it faster and smaller.\\n- Add to toolbox.json version of sysmodule so Sysmodules 1.4.0+ overlay can show properly sysmodule's version.\\n\\nv1.5.3\\nFixed a bug in 64-bit Core with FPSLocker patches that were using negative offsets in addresses (fixes an issue with WARRIORS OROCHI 4 / \u7121\u53ccOROCHI3 patches).\\n\\nv1.5.2\\nAdd support for changing in real time amount of buffers in compatible NVN games (Requires FPSLocker 3.0.1+)\\n\\nv1.5.0\\n- Add support for next generation of FPSLocker patches introduced in FPSLocker 3.0.0 release\\n- Fix compatibility with Unity 6 games (Hollow Knight Silksong, Disney Dreamlight Valley 1.18.0)\\n- NX-FPS: report resolutions only with width higher than 160 px\\n- FPSLocker patch is now applied every frame in handheld instead of every second. This can cause crashes with some old patches on game's boot, it can be solved by removing patch in FPSLocker, downloading new config with FPSLocker 3.0.0+ and creating from it new patch\\n- With each new release \"Debug_files.zip\" will be included for easier debugging of specific release version\\n\\nv1.4.8\\nFix a bug introduced in 1.4.3 release with underclocked OLED not readjusting colors after waking from sleep.\\n\\nv1.4.7\\nFixed a bug in vulkan layer, causing crash in Until Then game\\n\\nv1.4.6\\n- Share how many frames were generated by game (this fixes an issue with Status Monitor \"FPS Graph\" wrongly detecting paused games for brief moments, update Status Monitor to get proper support)\\n\\nv1.4.5\\nFix reporting doubled FPS value in Crypt of the NecroDancer\\n\\nv1.4.4\\nFix an issue where GetDefaultDisplayResolution could return 0x0 in some cases, leading to game crash.\\n\\nv1.4.3\\n- Add option to always force 60 Hz when in HOME Menu while Display Sync is turned on (requires FPSLocker 2.3.1+)\\n- Add support for overriding Default Display Resolution (Requires ReverseNX-RT 2.3.0+)\\n- Fix an issue for V1 and V2 models which in docked mode would report 0Hz if user was not using display sync\\n\\nShadow update 05.08.2025 07:16 GMT: Fixed an issue where disabling system control in ReverseNX-RT didn't update custom DDR in game.\\n\\nv1.4.2\\n- Fix an issue with Red Dead Redemption not detecting properly if it's in docked mode or handheld for NX-FPS internal use, causing FPS lock issues in docked mode\\n- Optimize dumping resolutions\\n\\nv1.4.0\\n- Read separately FPS targets for docked and handheld from FPSLocker save (requires FPSLocker 2.3.0+)\\n- Add SaltyNX version to logs of sysmodule and Cores\\n- Fix an issue with sysmodule not injecting Core anymore to next games if Core initialization failed which resulted in game crash before Core had a chance to close connection\\n- Improve NX-FPS's PFPS stat reporting\\n- Read separate docked overclocking settings for 720p (requires FPSLocker 2.3.0+)\\n- Now game read speed in Core is opt-out instead of opt-in (to get game read speed use Status Monitor Overlay 1.2.0+)\\n\\nv1.3.1\\n- Separate display sync for handheld and docked (Requires FPSLocker 2.2.1+ for proper support)\\n- Fix memory leak related to reading external display's config (it was crashing system)\\n- Give an option to measure game files read speed if filestats.flag exists\\n\\nv1.3.0-release\\n- Add support for overclocking compatible external display's refresh rate up to 120 Hz\\n- Add support for downclocking OLED internal display refresh rate down to 45 Hz\\n- Add support for downclocking Retro Remake SUPER5 refresh rate down to 40 Hz (with initial support for other Retro Remake displays)\\n- Fix an issue with not clearing shared memory after application is closed, resulting in tools such as Status Monitor and FPSLocker reporting false values\\n\\nRequires FPSLocker 2.2.0 and newer to properly utilize new functions. Its readme also has more informations about specific issues related to new functions.\\n\\n1.2.7\\nFix crash in some units when going to sleep mode (bug introduced in 1.2.6).\\n\\n1.2.5\\nAdd option to force game into custom made suspend when in Home Menu (requires FPSLocker 2.1.3+).\\n\\n1.2.4\\nFix FPS Lock not working when Display Sync was disabled.\\nReport proper interval for EGL if game is passing invalid value\\n\\n1.2.3\\nReduce size of Core32 by 15% and Core by 35% which allows us to make sysmodule take 64kB less RAM\\nAllow changing amount of buffers in Vulkan games (requires FPSLocker 1.2.2+)\\nFix an issue with some games overreporting frames (120 instead of 60), such as Hades\\nFix an issue where very few Erista units had constant image stutters and loading times increased since 1.2.0 release\\n\\n1.2.2\\nFixed an old bug where games with big .bss segment were booting significantly longer than other games (For example games using Regista or LucaSystem engine were booting 30-40 seconds. With this fix it's now less than 5 seconds).\\nSysmodule log now prints info how much time have passed since sysmodule booted.\\nMinor sysmodule optimizations",

            "details": "Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language was written by Charles Kapps[citation needed], who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nFeatures :\\n\\n- U can use differents accounts for play.\\n- Highscores\\n- Tactil\\nControls : - Double Touch or D-pad + A : Menu Selection - Short Touch or Short A : enable color - - : Back to menu - : Restart game - Plus : Exit game"

It's a rewrite of one of my previous projects for the Dingoo A320. It features 456 levels in four sizes: 5x5 (easy), 7x7, 10x10, 20x20 (hard). There's also a save state function, undo button, and more.\\n\\nRules\\nIn SlitherlinkNX, you draw lines on a grid to create a meandering path, following the rules:\\n\\nThe path must form a single loop, without crossing itself or branching.\\nThe numbers indicate how many lines surround each cell. Empty cells may be surrounded by any number of lines.\\nThere is one unique solution for each level. You can draw small x's on segments that cannot be connected. You should be able to find the solution by logical deduction only, without guessing.\\n\\nFor Slitherlink beginners, I strongly recommend to consult the Wikipedia page, especially chapter 'Solution methods', which is a big help at the start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink#Solution_methods\\n\\nControls\\nd-pad: move cursor\\nX/A/B/Y: draw a line, then a cross, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nL + X/A/B/Y: draw a cross, then a line, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nR: undo previous action\\n+: open menu, allowing to: retry, save state, or quit\\n\\nCredits\\nDevelopment: Tardigrade (http://beyondds.free.fr/)\\nOriginal game: Nikoli (http://www.nikoli.com/)\\nPuzzles: Krazydad (http://www.krazydad.com/slitherlink/)\\nFont: Chopin Script\\nSounds: Junggle\\nBackground: aopsan"

            "changelog": "v1.3.2\\n- Added compatibility for Atmosphere 1.10.0+ \\n  - Older SaltyNX releases can have random issues when using with Atmosphere 1.10.0 and newer. \\n  - This release is backwards compatible so you can use it with older Atmosphere too.\\n  - It is required to update to SaltyNX 1.6.0+ for the same reason!\\n- Optimize CPU usage calculation so now there is less time spend on executing each loop, in result getting more precise results\\n- Fix how CPU usage is calculated so now overlay doesn't report randomly minus 0.\\n\\nv1.3.1\\nFix an issue where in Mini and Full modes two resolutions were showing up next to each other, first being 0x0. Now it shows up only second resolution in that case.\\n\\nv1.3.0\\n- Add touch screen functionality to Mini, FPS Graph, FPS Counter and Game Resolutions modes.\\n  - You can now temporarily change position of them to wherever you want on screen. Position will reset after exiting chosen mode.\\n  - If you have issues with touch screen, you can disable touch screen functionality in config file by changing touch_screen to false, more here: https://github.com/masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay/blob/master/docs/config.md. \\n- Changed behavior of combo key so now it's more consistent between various FPS, now it won't exit until at least 200 ms will pass holding buttons.\\n- Instead of printing 254, 254.0 or inf for FPS it will print now \"n/d\" aka \"no data\". \\n\\nEdiit 30.10.2025 13:24 GMT: Fixed an issue with Mini mode going out of bounds when using touch screen to change its position, switching to docked mode which has different font size.\\n\\nv1.2.4\\nAdd to Mini Mode next to RAM Load which part of it belongs to CPU and GPU.\\n\\nv1.2.3\\nIn Full mode and Mini mode if only one reported resolution is changed, other one now stays in the same place. This solves an issue where some games have similar amount of calls to two different resolutions, resulting in constantly swapping places.\\n\\nv1.2.2\\n- Round FPS Average to PFPS if difference is in range +/- 0.25 (you can turn off rounding in config file), thanks to this we can minimize changes in FPS Average where some games are under constant changes while they provide in fact locked 60 FPS. For best results utilize always newest SaltyNX!\\n  - This wasn't utilized before because PFPS reading was too unstable so current solution would not work. In SaltyNX 1.4.0 was introduced a better way to measure PFPS without cheating which gives now much stable results for referencing.\\n- Change optimization level from -O2 to -O3 for better performance at cost of slighly bigger overlay\\n\\nv1.2.1\\n- Fix an issue with FPS Graph incorrectly detecting when game is paused, causing random pausing for a short moment (Requires SaltyNX 1.4.6+)\\n\\nv1.2.0\\n- Redesign game informations in Full mode to match stylistically with hardware informations\\n- Add information about game read speed in Full and Mini modes (for Mini mode you must add \"READ\" value to \"show\" key, more in docs and config template). Requires SaltyNX 1.4.0+ to work properly.\\n- Fix FPS Graph not showing properly max FPS value if display refresh rate is 100 Hz or higher\\n- Redesign sleep logic so now overlay has snappier reaction time\\n\\nShadow update 31.07.2025 17:45 GMT: Fixed threads related to reading CPU usage, it didn't apply proper logic to exit them immediately when requested which could slow down moving between different modes.\\n\\n1.1.9\\nFix an issue with FPS Graph not pausing when game doesn't push new frames\\n\\n1.1.8\\nAdd support for SaltyNX 1.2.1+\\nNow it can read viewport resolutions from EGL and Vulkan games\\nAdded font cache to lower impact on games performance (you can disable it in config.ini with key font_cache but it's not advised)\\nWhen there is only one resolution available to read, Full and Mini mode will print just one resolution instead of second being \"0x0\"\\nAlso figured out an issue that was bothering some people and that cannot be fixed:\\nSometimes I got reports that Status Monitor freezes when trying to open it, or Album freezes with Status Monitor already opened...\\nThat issue comes from having too much apps + sysmodules running that try to access sdcard.\\n\\nYou can disable SaltyNX logging with SaltyNX-Tool to have at least one session more available. If even disabling it doesn't help, consider removing sysmodules or killing them with Sysmodules overlay when not using them.\\n\\n1.1.7a\\n\\nAdd support for SaltyNX 1.2.0+ (older versions are now unsupported when it comes to using FPS Graph)\\nFix reading config issue for Mini mode #88\\n\\n1.1.6\\n\\nSmall code refactor which resulted in slightly smaller size\\nSupport SaltyNX 1.0.3+ display refresh rate update logic in FPS Graph to fix issue with graph randomly not adjusting height to refresh rate (if there is older SaltyNX used, overlay will use old logic)\\n\\n1.1.4\\n\\nFix issue with overlay potentially crashing system on overlay's boot related to nv services\\nFix potential issue with sleep mode at 19.0.0+ that was first discovered in sys-clk retronx-team/sys-clk#85\\nFor some reason using tsSessionGetTemperature is enough to crash system while is in sleep mode\\nIt was fixed by moving from ts service to i2c. Readings are not filtered, so reading output and behavior can be slightly different than what we were used to.\\n\\n1.1.3\\n\\nSwitch reading fan rotation level from \"fan\" service to \"pwm\" service\\nThis allows avoiding potential conflict with other homebrew/sysmodules (f.e. Nx-FanControl) because only one process can have fan controller session in \"fan\" service.\\n\\n1.1.2\\n\\nFix Resolutions sometimes going out of bounds in Full Mode\\nUpdate SaltyNX to 0.9.2+ for better compatibility with games using Id Tech engines and Creation Engine\\n\\n1.1.1\\n\\nAdded options to show 2 the best candidates for game's internal resolution in Mini and Full modes.\\nAdded keys to config that can disable showing FPS and Resolutions in Full mode\\nAdded value RES to show key in Mini mode that shows Resolutions.\\nUpdate SaltyNX to 0.9.1+ for better compatibility with games using Id Tech engines",

This one is full of fixes and improvements. And also...\\n\\nNew Ports:\\n\\nAdded 3DS port! This version allows you to swap between the top and bottom screens, so you can choose between the top screen's wider aspect ratio or the bottom screen's touch controls.\\nIt runs at an average of around 58 FPS on a New 3DS, or around 21 FPS on an Old 3DS (though this only really affects how smooth the background scrolling is).\\n(Re-)Added Android port! This was dropped a few versions ago, but now it's back with all the latest enhancements. And your game is now autosaved when you minimize the app via the Home/Recent Apps button.\\nIf you already had the old version installed, you should uninstall it before getting this one since it won't overwrite.\\nChanges:\\n\\nEnhanced controller support! Input is now read from all connected controllers, and you can freely connect/disconnect controllers as desired.\\nScaled background size relative to screen resolution. This means all resolutions should now have around the same background sizes as opposed to large resolutions being tiny.\\nRedesigned the grid and menu cursors. The grid cursor is now slightly smaller in 240p, and slightly larger in other resolutions.\\n[PC (Windows+Linux)] Progress is now autosaved when exiting via the window's X button (or right click -> Close window).\\n[Linux] Set Native resolution as default.\\nTechnical Improvements:\\n\\nTons of performance optimizations! These were needed for the 3DS port since it uses software rendering, but other systems also benefit. These include heavily optimizing sprite transparency, scaling, text surfaces, and code inlining, along with a bunch of other minor optimizations that add up.\\n3DS frame rate is around 2-3x what it was before these changes were made.\\nTo use an existing port as a comparison, PSP FPS increased from low 40s to low 50s.\\nReduced file size, RAM usage, and load times by optimizing graphics.\\nThe FunKey version in particular is now less than 1 MB!\\n[Windows] The game is now compiled with MSYS instead of Visual Studio, and DLLs are now statically linked to the executable. That means the entire game is now a single EXE.\\nIn my testing, the x64 version flagged Windows Defender on one machine. This is a false positive; if it happens to you, just use the x86 version instead.\\nOther assorted improvements and cleanup.\\nBug Fixes:\\n\\nFixed grid number placement. Numbers are now more consistently in the middle of each cell, regardless of resolution or position.\\nImproved grid cursor placement. Likewise, the position of the cursor sprites is now more consistent.\\n[FunKey] Fixed some visual inconsistencies to match the SDL2 versions.\\nEnjoy!",

(https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/SR_Class/OS-ISRM_SlideRuleSeminar.pdf)\\n\\nIssues:\\nSlowly sliding your finger horizontally across the screen is kinda jittery and makes lining up your calculation a bit of a pain. To counter this, slide at a normal speed and a steep vertical angle. The vertical component of the slide will effectively just get ignored but the small horizontal component will always be accounted for.\\nThe scales won't line up perfectly when slid relative to one another because I only lined up the gradations with the nearest pixel. So for example, the 3.4 line would go at x position 1280*log\u2081\u2080(3.4) = 680.293, so I just put it at x coordinate 680. They should all be close enough to the true value that the power of estimation will give you accurate enough results.\\n\\nTake advantage of the power of iteration to get increasingly accurate results. For example, say you wanted to know 590\u00f7101.\\n\\n1. Estimate what the answer should be. 590 is about 600 and 101 is about 100, so 590\u00f7101 should be about 6.\\n2. Use the slide rule to get an answer of about 5.84.\\n3. 5.84\u00d7101 = 589.84. This means our error is (590-589.84)\u00f7101 = 0.16\u00f7101.\\n4. Use the slide rule to evaluate 0.16\u00f7101 to be about 0.001584.\\n5. Add the error correction to our first calculation to get 590\u00f7101 = 5.841584.\\n6. 5.841584\u00d7101 = 589.999984. If this still isn't accurate enough for what you're doing, iterate again. In this case though, you could just notice that the next iteration would be a power of 10 times a previous iteration, meaning you've already found the repeating decimal expansion.\\n\\nThe scales from top to bottom are:\\n\\n- Double Logarithmic (1 to 10 to 100)\\n- Folded Single Logarithmic with index at Pi (\u03c0 to 10, 10 = 1, 1 to \u03c0)\\n\\n- Blue line denoting boundary between slide and top stator\\n- Folded Single Logarithmic with index at Pi (\u03c0 to 10, 10 = 1, 1 to \u03c0)\\n- Red Inverse Single Logarithmic (10 to 1)\\n- Single Logarithmic (1 to 10)\\n\\n- Blue line denoting boundary between slide and botom stator\\n\\n- Single Logarithmic (1 to 10)\\n- Linear (0 to 1)\\n\\nFuck OpenGL and gpu compute, software render is all I need.\\n"

            "details": "This is an experimental sysmodule that allows capturing the running game output to a pc via USB or network connection.\\nTwo versions are provided:\\n\\nSysDVR.zip is the \"full\" version, can stream using both modes and comes with an homebrew app to switch between them\\nSysDVR-USB-Only.zip(not included in this download) will only stream via USB but uses less memory and should run alongside multiple sysmodules.\\nYou should use the full version unless you have specific requirements.\\n\\nTo play the stream mpv player is recommended as it's the most straight forward to set up, any other player that supports raw h264 streams via tcp or stdin should work but you may have to configure it manually.\\n\\nLimitations\\nVideo quality is fixed to 720p @ 30fps with h264 compression (hardware limit)\\nAudio quality is fixed to 16bit PCM @ 48kHz stereo. Not compressed\\nOnly works on games that have video recording enabled (aka you can long-press the capture button to save a video)\\nVideo and audio are two different streams, they're likely to desync as they require two different player instances. Vlc does support a secondary audio stream but i didn't manage to get it working properly.\\nOnly captures game output. System UI, home menu and homebrews running as applet won't be captured\\nVideo feed is not realtime, there will always be a minimum of ~1 second of delay.\\nStream quality depends heavily on the environment, bad usb wires or low wifi signal can affect it significantly.\\nUSB streaming is not available when docked\\nRequires firmware >= 6.0.0\\nClearly with these limitations this sysmodule doesn't allow \"remote play\" and does not replace a capture card.\\n\\nUsage\\nSetting up the sysmodule\\nThe provided builds already contain the correct file structure, you should just be able to extract them to your sd card.\\nCFWs other than atmosphere should work but I won't provide support for them.\\n\\nBy default SysDVR will stream over network, to switch between modes and set the default one you can use the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.\\n\\nNetwork streaming\\nThis is the easiest way to stream, In this mode the sysmodule is completely standalone, you should be able to play the video stream just by running mpv tcp://<switch ip address>:6666 --no-correct-pts --fps=30 and mpv tcp://<switch ip addr>:6667 --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000 for audio.\\nWhen using network streaming it's not recommended to stream both audio and video at the same time as it may cause slowdowns. In general network streaming has more lag and delay compared to USB, it is worth the time to set it up, especially for gameplay recording.\\n\\nUSB streaming\\nTo stream via usb you need the UsbStream program, it's built using .NET core and is compatible with linux as well.\\nFirst of all you should make sure to install .NET core 3 on your pc, then proceed to setup the drivers, this step is needed only the first time:\\n\\nDriver setup on windows\\nOn windows you may get the device not found or platform not supported errors or very bad performance on the stream, in this case you may have the wrong driver set up.\\nPlug your switch in the computer while running SysDVR in USB mode and launch zadig install the libusb-win32 driver for the \"Nintendo Switch\" device. Before installing make sure the target device USB ID is 057e 3006, if it's different the sysmodule may not be running, try waiting a bit (it should start around 20 seconds after the console boot) or check again your setup.\\nThis won't interfere with other applications that communicate with the switch via usb as this sysmodule uses a different product id.\\n\\nDriver setup on linux\\nOn linux you may have errors about loading the libusb-1.0 library, this happens when the file name is different than the one expected by dotnet, you can make a symlink as described on the LibUsbDotNet repo:\\nsudo find / -name \"libusb-1.0*.so*\" and then\\n\\ncd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\\nsudo ln -s libusb-1.0.so.0 libusb-1.0.so\\n(Example commands, change the paths with the one you find on your pc)\\n\\nStreaming\\nMost Windows users can simply use UsbStreamGUI, it will allow you to select the streaming mode and launch UsbStream directly.\\n\\nLinux users will have to use the UsbStream command line interface (Note that this is available on windows too and provides a few more options compared to UsbStreamGUI)\\nLaunch UsbStream like this: UsbStream video <streaming mode> <arg> audio <streaming mode> <arg>\\nThese are valid streaming modes:\\n\\nstdin : pipes the received data directly to a video player via stdin, this will use no caching so you'll have low delay but it may lag. This will likely require you to provide the args to pass to the player, you can do so like this: video stdin <player executable> args \"<args list>\"\\nmpv : same as stdin but will automatically set up the args for mpv so it just requires the path\\ntcp : opens a tcp server so players can connect to it and use their own caching mechanism to remove or reduce lag (at the price of an higher delay)\\nfile : writes the received data directly to a file so it can be converted to a common format later.\\nWhen using mpv the arg is the path of mpv on your pc (use the .com file on windows), you have to repeat it twice if using both streams.\\nThe tcp option requires a free port number and the file option the output file path.\\nTo disable a stream just omit the name and its fields.\\n\\nExample commands:\\n\\nUsbStream audio mpv C:/programs/mpv/mpv : Plays audio via mpv located at C:/programs/mpv/mpv, video is ignored\\nUsbStream video mpv ./mpv audio mpv ./mpv : Plays video and audio via mpv (path has to be specified twice)\\nUsbStream video tcp 1337 audio file C:/audio.raw : Streams video over port 1337 while saving audio to disk\\nLaunching UsbStream without any parameter will display more options and examples.\\nTo connect to the tcp streams you can use: mpv tcp://localhost:<video port> --no-correct-pts --fps=30 for video and mpv tcp://localhost:<audio port> --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000 for audio\\n\\nTips\\nTo get the most out of this sysmodule you will have to do some testing to find configuration that works best for you, here are some tips and useful information:\\n\\nIf the video stream doesn't start immediately try moving the camera around in the game, to display something the video player needs to acquire a video keyframe first.\\nAn usb 3 wire is slightly better than usb 2, but both should work.\\nQuality also depends on the cpu utilization of the game you're running, OC can improve performances.\\nUsing cache will reduce lags at the cost of an higher delay, for mpv it's on by default (except when using usb stream with mpv mode), if you want to try without it the command line arg for mpv is --cache=no --cache-secs=0. There's a lot of room for experimenting here, try different values to find the combination that works best for you.\\nIf using no caching when the screen goes full black or white (eg loading screens) it may cause some desync and the stream will start to drop frames, eventually it will fix by itself but it could take some time, the fastest solution is to open the home menu for a few seconds and then resume the game, for usb stream you can try setting the --desync-fix flag (this will introduce glitches).\\nCommon issues\\nAfter copying the sysmodule to the sd atmosphere won't boot anymore\\nThis happens if you have too many sysmodules or ones particulary heavy like sysftpd, remove them to launch SysDVR.\\nIf you really need other sysmodules at the same time you can try using the USB-Only version as it uses less memory (512K vs 3MB)\\nTo remove SysDVR delete the /atmosphere/titles/00FF0000A53BB665 folder, to remove other sysmodules if you're not sure about the right ID delete the whole /atmosphere folder and download a fresh copy of atmosphere.\\n\\nHomebrews using USB like GoldLeaf or nxmtp won't launch anymore\\nThis is because the USB interface is being used by SysDVR, if you're using the full version you can swith streaming modes using the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.\\n\\nWhen using network stream there's a lot of delay or it increses over time\\nMpv will use a cache buffer to avoid lag when the connection drops some packets but this increases delay, you can disable it by using --cache=no --cache-secs=0\\n\\nThe video is laggy or there are a lot of glitches\\nMake sure the connection between the console and your pc is good enough, if streaming via network move both closer to the router or switch to LAN, for USB try using an higher quality wire.",
            "changelog": "v6.2.2\\nThis release fixes a number of minor issues reported by users.\\nMost importantly the sysmodule and settings app are now built using latest libnx for 21.0 support.\\n\\nSince 21.0 further reduced the available memory for sysmodules remember that you can load and unload SysDVR at any time from the settings app. You can also use the usb-only build which does not support streaming over the network but uses less memory.\\nFor reference, as of this release SysDVR uses slightly less than 1MB of ram while the usb-only version around 500KB.\\n\\n6.2.1\\nThis releases introduces support for dynamically terminating and starting the SysDVR sysmodule without rebooting the console.\\nThis feature should help reduce the impact of the new memory limits added on firmware 20.0.\\nThis feature is available both in the settings homebrew and for use for third party sysmodule managers through the toolbox.json file\\n\\n6.2\\nFix video recording when recording two videos in a row (#307)\\nAdded an option to disable controller input when playing through a PC (#315)\\nAdded Spanish language by @unaigonzalezz (#290)\\nAdded Brazilian Portuguese language by @discollizard (#293)",

It features some bugfixes, optimizations, and other improvements backported from the v1.5 development tree.\\n\\nReworked gamepad input handling and configuration:\\nThe free/restricted axis distinction is gone; the joystick always operates in \"free\" mode.\\nAdded direction snapping functionality to help aid exact movement in cardinal and/or diagonal directions. The snapping angle can be adjusted from 0% (disabled) to 100% (similar to the old \"restricted\" mode). The snapping angle can also be biased towards cardinals or diagonals.\\nWhen the maximum zone is less than or equals dead zone, moving the character will always move at maximum speed (as in the old \"restricted\" mode).\\nMost of these settings are now visualized in the options menu and can be tested there.\\nChanged the default Spell Card (Bomb) and Power Surage gamepad bindings to Left Trigger and Right Trigger respectively.\\nIf autorestart is enabled for spell practice, it will now try to load a quicksave if one exists.\\nAdded a \"load quicksave\" option to the pause menu in practice modes.\\nCutscenes that have been seen before can now be completely skipped.\\nAdded an option to reset the config to last saved values.\\nReduced some sprite batching CPU overhead.\\nOptimized rendering of scenes with many lasers.\\nOptimized loading of webp files.\\nOptimized various math routines.\\nImproved performance of some shaders.\\nDue to bad OpenGL drivers, macOS releases now use ANGLE for rendering by default. This fixes serious performance issues on some Apple systems.\\nWorked around broken rendering in WebGL on Apple systems with certain versions of ANGLE (see #386). The ANGLE bug has been fixed upstream, but certain systems are known to still be affected, such as iOS 18.\\nFixed crashes related to opening the pause menu.\\nFixed the cutscene text spontaneously disappearing on some systems.\\nFixed laser rendering errors during screen-shake effects.\\nFixed some minor general rendering errors.\\nFixed rendering errors specific to WebGL and ANGLE on Windows.\\nFixed ongoing asynchronous tasks (e.g. screenshot encoding) sometimes failing to finish when exiting the game.\\nFixed some erroneous build warnings when building with Clang 18+.\\nFixed pseudo-random lookup order when a resource exists in multiple locations. This allows files placed in sub-packages to override those from 00-taisei.zip reliably.\\nRemoved the defunct gles20 renderer backend.\\nScreenshots now use asynchronous GPU downloads.\\nAdded --width and --height command line parameters.\\nThe default config can now be customized by adding a config.default file to the game's resources.\\nAdded documentation for previously undocumented environment variables to ENVIRON.rst.\\nAdded an experimental \"framedump\" mode that can be used to render videos; see ENVIRON.rst for details.\\nAdded a watchdog in kiosk mode that resets the game to the main menu and default settings after a period of inactivity.\\nAdded the TAISEI_KIOSK_PREVENT_QUIT environment variable to control whether Quit is available in kiosk mode.\\nAdded a some basic test programs for the renderer API.\\n\\n1.4.1\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features some bugfixes and optimizations backported from the v1.5 development tree.\\n\\nFixed a crash that happened after a few minutes would pass without any input if the intro cutscene had previously played (#371).\\nFixed a crash when attempting to start a stage on OpenBSD systems (#372).\\nFixed heavy audio distortion on the Switch (#374).\\nThis was a matter of updating the SDK, and entailed no code changes on Taisei's side.\\nOn the Switch the resolution will now automatically adapt to the console's docked/undocked state.\\nThreaded loading is now enabled on the Switch.\\nOptimized a few hot paths in the game update loop.\\nOptimized the tree branch mesh in the Stage 2 background to avoid rendering a lot of tiny triangles.\\nWorked around a Meson issue that broke Emscripten builds (42a7e49).\\nEnabled some \"modern\" WASM features for the Emscripten build. This raises the browser version requirements for the official build to Chromium 91 or Firefox 89.\\nAdded a gamemode build option to control whether to enable GameMode integration on Linux.\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nThis is a major release, with substantially redesigned stages and bosses, new story, new backgrounds, and heavy internal rewrites.\\n\\n1.3.2\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features various bugfixes, optimizations, and minor features backported from the v1.4 development tree.\\n\\nThere are no gameplay changes and this version should be replay-compatible with the initial v1.3 release.\\n\\n1.3.1\\n\\nSilent update : recompiled with latest libnx\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features some important bugfixes and a few optimizations and visual improvements backported from the v1.4 development tree, as well as new character art by @afensorm.\\n\\nOther than fixing some rare game-breaking bugs, there are no gameplay changes and this version should be replay-compatible with the initial v1.3 release.\\n\\nSemi-official homebrew Switch binaries are now also available, thanks to @p-sam's porting efforts.

With this update I tweaked the engine a bit to improve the playing experience in the long run. I hope I've made progress towards my goal, improving your playing experience too!\\n\\nFollow the instructions on README.md to know how to install ONScripter-NX.\\n\\nGame-specific zips are just convenience builds.\\nThey already come with some of the necessary files included, so you just need to copy the arc*.nsa/arc*.sar files from an original copy of the game.\\n\\nChangelog:\\n\\nHD support - yes! Play your old novel like you had never been able to! More info about it in the README page (seriously, read it!)\\nA new command has been added to adjust text display speed.\\nBy pressing the Left Stick, you can switch between the three available text display speeds (slow~normal~fast).\\nONScripter-NX will also memorize your selected text speed for that game.\\nMenu navigation is now a lot easier thanks to repeated input support.\\nNow you can hold the stick to scroll menu entries faster.\\nThis also works when navigating text history using D-Up and D-Down, and basically in every other directional input use case too.\\nNow the app deinitializes RomFS properly at shutdown.\\nA proper deinit function has been created. It will be called at app's shutdown, and will be eventually populated with more deinitializing code, if needed in the future. For now it just contains the RomFS deinit call...",

Critical bug fix causing crashes on the packages / package menu when not on Wi-Fi.\\n2. unpackDeviceInfo sequencing correction.\\n3. Added curl_global_cleanup to exitServices (to cleanup curl global resources on app exit).\\n4. Buffer initialization correction for download / unzip functions.\\n\\nv2.2.4\\nList of changes:\\n1. OverlayFrame titles now auto-scroll when too long or covered by the widget (just like subtitles).\\n2. Copy, move, and delete wildcard commands now support -filter   (path to a text file containing a list of files / folders to be filtered from pattern resolution).\\n3. -filter now properly resolves ./ and ../ paths and no longer require hardcoded sdmc:/ in the file / folder paths.\\n4. Fixed script overlay for track bars.\\n\\nv2.2.3\\nList of changes:\\n1. Improvements to the List class in libultrahand.\\n    - No more pointer caching (less memory usage, faster openings / list to list transitions, more consistent behavior).\\n    - Proper \"wall\" handling for initial clicks that select the first / last ListItems (no instant wrap around until subsequent clicks).\\n    - Theme variable trackbar_color is now scrollbar_color + new color scrollbar_wall_color (triggered when tapping ends of the list).\\n        - Updates to ultra.ini and ultra-blue.ini themes (as well as default).\\n            - Themes will need to be re-applied for changes to be applied.\\n    - Fixes to the \"immediate focus\" implementation introduced in v2.2.2.\\n2. New package command header ;footer= and ;footer_highlight=.\\n    - ;footer= allows users to pre-define a default footer value for a package command (to be used, stored, and set when no footer exists in the config.ini for the package.\\n    - ;footer_highlight= is a true / false parameter that will draw the footer with the highlight color when on.\\n        - footer_highlight is also a new key to be used in the config.ini for manually configuring the footer highlight for the command.\\n3. Hold mode ;mode=hold is no longer a command mode and can now be set for default, option, and slot commands via ;hold=true.\\n    - The default generated package.ini now uses this command header.\\n        - Users may want to delete their /switch/.packages/package.ini and have Ultrahand re-generate it if they are still using the old package.ini.\\n    - Side-note:- If using ;mode=hold, users will need to update their commands to leverage ;hold=true instead.\\n4. Fixes to the placeholder parsing implementation.\\n    - Proper handling and resolution sequencing of unresolved placeholders.\\n    - Placeholder methods before the _source definitions are now carried over to the rest of the commands (rather than reset).\\n5. Touch improvements to track-bars.\\n6. Optimizations to command menu drawings.\\n7. Various corrections, bug fixes, and improvements.\\n\\nv2.2.2\\nStability Update\\n\\nList of changes:\\n1. Proper fix for default combo initializations (on fresh installs).\\n    - Launch combo is first checked and loaded from /config/tesla/config.ini.\\n    - If the Tesla combo does not exist, and no combo in /config/ultrahand/config.ini exists, users can use the default Tesla combo (L+DDOWN+RS) or the default Ultrahand combo (ZL+ZR+DDOWN) for initializing their default combo.\\n        - Once initialized, Ultrahand will assume the combo the user used until changed in the Settings menu.\\n2. Bug fix for returning from an overlay while touch is still in progress (multiple cursors).\\n    - If foreground is in focus and a button is clicked while touch is in progress, input will now be prevented (with button click feedback).\\n3. Bug fix for returning to the overlay menu after using an overlay launch combo and exiting the overlay (KEY_B click).\\n    - Before the jumpToItem implementation would kick in on the next launch of Ultrahand after closing the overlay, causing the cursor to shift unnecessarily to the last open overlay title on the overlay menu.\\n4. Bug fix for widget settings not auto-loading on first fresh install launch.\\n\\nv2.2.1\\nList of changes:\\n1. New command mode ;mode=hold for triggering a \"hold A to execute\" type response (similar to default).\\n    - The pre-generated package.ini now utilizes ;mode=hold for its shutdown command.\\n2. New commands set-ini-val-matching-key, remove-ini-key-matching-key, and path_exists.\\n    - set-ini-val-matching-key will set an ini value to all ini sections that include the matching pattern key.\\n        - Called set-ini-val-matching-key <FILE_PATH> <PATTERN_KEY> <DESIRED_KEY> <DESIRED_VALUE>.\\n    - remove-ini-key-matching-key will remove all key value pairs from an ini from sections that include a matching pattern key.\\n        - Called remove-ini-key-matching-key <FILE_PATH> <PATTERN_KEY> <DESIRED_KEY>.\\n    - path_exists will return command success or failure based upon if the path provided exists or not.\\n        - Called path_exists <PATH>.\\n        - Can be quite useful when chained within try: blocks.\\n3. Placeholder replacement improvements for chaining with a source command.\\n    - In addition to ini_file (like before), users can now use the full catalogue of placeholders and chain them with their _source method definition.\\n    - Various improvements to placeholder replacements.\\n4. Slight refinements to list_file_source to include newlines when chained with tables.\\n    - Slight formatting improvements for tables on the ScriptOverlay.\\n5. New package Memory Kit: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Memory-Kit (latest revision of the old Memory Config: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/tree/main/examples/Memory%20Config package example; Ultrahand v2.2.1+ only).\\n    - This package includes the mesosphere.bin memory hack: https://github.com/Craftyawesome/Atmosphere/tree/memory-hack (1.85 MB + stripped).\\n        - Keep in mind that the stripped version will break the web browser, which will cause crashes on certain games and apps that utilize the web browser.\\n        - The 1.85 MB version however should not have any issues.\\n    - Regular users should not- touch the Configure Commands tab as it is strictly available for development and testing of memory configurations for the libultrahand.\\n6. Improvement to haptics (stronger and more consistent feedback).\\n7. Bug fix for combos on forced AMS v1.10+ support overlays.\\n    - Combos were not working properly for overlays with forced support.\\n    - Forced AMS v1.10+ support is not recommended, but can still be used with manual patching overlay binaries.\\n        - It is highly recommended that all overlays get recompiled for proper AMS v1.10+ support.\\n8. New unsupported warning notification displayed when trying to launch an unsupported overlay.\\n9. All pages now get drawn with the cursor automatically set (no cursor flickering into view).\\n10. Bug fix for sluggish table scrolling after triggering a jump / wrap to bottom.\\n11. Bug fix for exit sound + haptics kicking in when combo launching an overlay during a notification.\\n12. Bug fix for degrees symbol on Chinese fonts.\\n13. Slight optimizations to stbtt_FindGlyphIndex_impl.\\n14. Various additional tweaks, bug fixes and corrections.\\n\\nv2.2.0\\nList of changes:\\n1. New overlay heap size configurations with automatic reloads (in the System Settings menu).\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 21+ is now set to 4MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader-).\\n        - Although rare, some overlays may not work properly on 4MB (without a fix implemented).\\n            - To fix some of these overlays, they should be using socketInitialize instead of socketInitializeDefault (if utilized).\\n            - Overlays should also not be utilizing a full 1280x720p framebuffer when on 4MB.\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 20 is now set to 6MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader).\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 19 and lower is now set to 8MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader+).\\n    - Users can also add a 4th higher option by adding to /config/ultrahand/config.ini a new section memory with key custom_overlay_memory_MB and an integer value (2MB intervals greater than 8MB only).\\n        - After adding that entry, a 4th memory option will appear (displayed as nx-ovlloader\u00d7).\\n    - If Ultrahand deems there is not enough memory (at least 5.3 MB free after potential changes), then changes will not be applied.\\n2. Users can now completely exit the overlay system from the System Settings menu.\\n    - This will recover all memory consumed by nx-ovlloader / Ultrahand Overlay.\\n    - Users can then use Ultrahand-Reload.nro from homebrew launcher (now bundled with nx-ovlloader) to restart / reset nx-ovlloader without rebooting.\\n3. Commands move, copy, delete, and dot-clean memory optimizations.\\n    - Larger deletes, moves, and copies than v2.1.8 are now possible (even on a 4MB heap).\\n    - dot-clean now also removes all .DS_Store files for the specified directory (and subdirectories).\\n4. Now bundled with nx-ovlloader v2.0.0: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlloader/releases/tag/v2.0.0 (which includes the new helper module nx-ovlreloader: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlreloader).\\n    - nx-ovlloader+ compilation has been discontinued (no longer necessary).\\n    - The nx-ovloader+ zip on v2.0.0 is the same as nx-ovlloader.\\n        - It is provided for now during a grace period to ensure users can easily update from the system settings menu.\\n        - In the future after nx-ovlloader v2.0.0, if not on Ultrahand Overlay v2.2.0+, update methods might- be broken.\\n    - Side-note:- Users no longer need the /config/ultrahand/expansion/ folder and can safely delete it after updating.\\n5. Software updates now have the option to download a temporary update.ini command file (if provided on release) for micro managing the installation / update process.\\n    - Software updates instructions have also been slightly reworked for easier management.\\n6. Command exec now can be called with any package ini file (in addition to boot_package.ini like before).\\n    - Users can call this with exec <ENTRY_NAME> [ULTRAHAND_INI_FILE_PATH].\\n        - ULTRAHAND_INI_FILE_PATH in this case is an optional parameter, the path to the package ini file containing the command entry.\\n        - When not provided, it will assume commands from boot_package.ini (just like before).\\n7. Slight improvements to notifications (new tsl::notification->showNow implementation).\\n    - This allows instant display of the notification without waiting for the last notification to transition.\\n    - Packages can also use showNow via notify-now or notification-now (called the same way as notify / notification).\\n8. Sound effects now work on 6MB+ overlay heap sizes (disabled on 4MB).\\n9. Improvements to TrackBar touch.\\n10. Improvements to touch haptics (now to trigger on touch).\\n11. Improvements rounded rects and circles (slightly more refined AA).\\n12. Changes to socket initialization for improved memory usage (enables downloads on 4MB and improved memory).\\n13. Bug fix for haptics becoming disabled after sleep.\\n14. Bug fix for ;display_title= in packages interfering with proper returns to the last selected list item on the menu (as seen with returning from Alchemist).\\n15. Various tweaks, optimizations, bug fixes, and corrections.",

In my experience this makes a few things look a bit better, might(?) smooth out performance, and futureproofs everything a touch (in case someone wanted to implement a newer renderer engine later down the line).\\n\\nIf upgrading from a previous build, all you need to replace is VoyagerNX.nro.\\n\\nv0.8.4 - Better Gyro Support\\n\\nGyro now automatically detects whether the user's controller is in handheld or wireless mode and adjusts the axis accordingly. Haven't tested with a pro controller, but would imagine it should work fine, as the fix specifically targets handheld mode. This means apart from finding slightly more natural gyro defaults for both handheld and wireless mode, the end user can enjoy seamless gyro controls between input methods. (Note you'll still have to enable gyro manually by typing \"in_gyromouse 1\" in the console or copying the hmconfig.cfg settings from the GitHub readme, as there's still no menu prompt for it). Also, properly switched to \"main\" branch as the, well, main branch (hello Tulip Voyager!)\\n\\nIf updating an older version, extract to the original folder and replace all files when prompted.\\n\\nv0.8.3 - Basic Gyro Support\\n\\nIncluded is a build with basic gyro support that I'd consider stable still incomplete (no menu options, gyro code doesn't automatically detect controller and switch the yaw axis between yaw/roll), so it's being moved up to v0.8.3\\n\\nTo enable gyro support, you have to open the console menu in-game, type \"/in_gyromouse 1\". The stock gyro configuration is meant for handheld use, so if you're using a pro/wireless controller you'll have to also type \"/in_gyromouse_yaw_axis 1\" (and if you want to go back to handheld type the last command with a 0 instead of 1).

If you've used Zeldadungeons interactive map, then you know what they are.\\nAdded support for Master Mode. Press Y to toggle it.\\nDrastically improved performance when a lot of objects are displayed. Can easily run at 60fps now.\\nThe app remebers your last camera position and zoom.

            "details": "Virtual amiibo (amiibo emulation) system for Nintendo Switch\\n\\n## Virtual amiibos\\nVirtual amiibos go inside `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo`. For instance, an amiibo named `MyMario` would be `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo/MyMario/<amiibo content>`. They can go inside sub-directories, like `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo/SSBU/Yoshi`.\\n\\nA virtual amiibo is detected by emuiibo based on two aspects: a `amiibo.json` and a `amiibo.flag` file must exist inside the virtual amiibo's folder mentioned above. If (for whatever reason) you would like to disable a virtual amiibo from being recognised by emuiibo, just remove the flag file, and create it again to enable it.\\n\\nThe JSON file contains all the aspects and data an amiibo needs to provide to games, except a few special ones (per-game savedata, protocol and tag type...)\\n\\n## Usage and controlling\\n\\nIf you set up everything mentioned above, you're ready to use emuiibo ingame.\\n\\n**Tip:** Enable it (emulation status) before you start a game, because it does not work in some games if you enable it after launching the game! It really depends on how the game uses amiibos internally, so this guarantees emuiibo will intercept the game.\\n\\nTo see if emuiibo is working ingame, check if emuiibo is intercepting the game when it's trying to access amiibos. If it's not, try launching the game with emuiibo enabled first.\\n\\nTo open the Tesla overlay, hold down **L1 + DPAD-down** and then press **R3 (right stick)**. If you did it, the overlay will open on the left side of the screen. Now choose emuiibo.\\n\\nYou can see/control the following options in the top part of the overlay:\\n\\n- **Emulation status (on/off)**: when emuiibo's emulation status is on, it means that any game trying to access/read amiibos will be intercepted by emuiibo. When it's off, it means that amiibo services will work normally, and nothing will be intercepted. This is basically a toggle to globally disable or enable amiibo emulation.\\n\\n- **Active virtual amiibo**: it's the amiibo which will be sent to the games which try to scan amiibos, if emulation is on. If the amiibo happens to have an image, this will be displayed in the top part of the overlay.\\n\\n- **Virtual amiibo status (connected/disconnected)**: when the active virtual amiibo is connected, it means that the amiibo is always \"placed\", as if you were holding a real amiibo on the NFC point and never moving it - the game always detects it. When it is disconnected, it means that you \"removed\" it, as if you just removed the amiibo from the NFC point. Some games might ask you to remove the amiibo after saving data, so you must disconnect the virtual amiibo to \"simulate\" that removal. This is a recent feature, since emuiibo tried to handle this automatically in previous versions, causing some games to fail.\\n\\n- **Random UUID (on/off)**: when a virtual amiibo is selected, this will toggle the random UUID option on the amiibo (see above), which will make emuiibo use randomized UUIDs any time a game accesses the amiibo.\\n\\nIn the main menu of the bottom part, You can browse virtual amiibos (and thus select them) through the (sub)directories in `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo`. You can also mark some of them as favorites, which can be easily accessed from a separate menu below.\\n\\nAfter you selected an amiibo, you can see it's selected on top in the overlay and that it is *connected*.\\nA virtual amiibo being **connected** is the equivalent of holding a real amiibo figurine/card on the NFC point. To **disconnect** the amiibo (the equivalent of removing a real amiibo from the NFC point), just select the same amiibo again.\\n\\nTo go back in the menus, just press **B** button.\\n\\n**Example of use**:\\n\\n1. Open the overlay and choose emuiibo\\n2. Enable emuiibo\\n3. Start the game\\n4. Navigate to the games NFC feature to use the amiibo and activate it\\n5. Open the overlay and choose your amiibo (the amiibo will then be *connected*).\\n6. The game should now register/make use of it\\n7. If the game tells you to remove the amiibo, *disconnect* it.\\n\\n## For developers\\nemuiibo hosts a custom IPC service, also named emuiibo, which can be used to control amiibo emulation by other homebrew tools.\\n\\nThe overlay's code serves a good example to see how to control emuiibo with libnx.\\n\\n## Credits\\n- Everyone who contributed to the original nfp-mitm project (and other forks): Subv, ogniK, averne, spx01, SciresM\\n- AmiiboAPI web API, which is used by emutool to get a proper, full amiibo list, in order to generate virtual amiibos.\\n- 3dbrew for their detailed documentation of amiibos, even though some aspects are different on the Switch.\\n- LoOkYe for writing emuiibo's wiki and helping with support.\\n- AD2076 and AmonRaNet for helping with the tesla overlay.\\n- AmonRaNet for all the work he put into the overlay.\\n- AmonRaNet, Impeeza, amazingfate, qazrfv1234, shadow2560 and SimoCasa for providing/helping with translations.\\n- Thog / Ryujinx devs for reversing mii services and various of its types.\\n- Citra devs for several amiibo formats used in 3DS systems.\\n- Manlibear for helping with improvements and development of emutool.\\n- All the testers and supporters from my Discord server who were essential for making this project progress and become what it is now :)\\n\\n## License exemption\\n\\nThe Ryujinx project/team is exempt from GPLv2 licensing, and may make use of emuiibo's code licensing it under their current license.",

You can also add your own profiles by pressing Y on the main tab. Any changes will be saved to gzdoom/launcher.ini.\\nThe launcher will only detect files in gzdoom/iwads and gzdoom/pwads. You can use the Override RSP file option if you have to load files from other locations.\\nMultiplayer does work, however only Switch <=> PC multiplayer has been tested. You can start a netgame from the launcher.

Well, now you can play your games portably anywhere in your house!\\n\\nThis project is fairly new, so please do not consider it totally stable. If you encounter issues, feel free to submit them.\\n\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n- Stream PC screen to a Nintendo Switch in your local network\\n- 720p (full Switch-Tablet display resolution)\\n- 40-60 FPS (if not see Troubleshooting)\\n- Low delay (again, see Troubleshooting)\\n- Capture controller input on Nintendo Switch\\n- Emulate an Xbox controller on the PC\\n- PC app offers picture quality adjustments\\n\\n\\nHow to Use:\\n\\nFor the PC App, you will need to execute In-Home-Switching.exe which you can download from:\\nhttps://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/releases\\n\\nOn PC, Scp drivers must also be installed (just unzip and execute Driver Installer/ScpDriverInstaller.exe). Otherwise the program will crash silently.\\n\\nAlso please set your PC resolution to 1280x720p in Windows for getting much better performance of screen capturing while running the app.\\n\\nOn the Switch, find out its IP address (in the Internet settings) and start the app with your Switch CFW. Then type in the Switch's IP address on the PC app and hit the Connect button.\\n\\n\\nCurrent Limitations:\\n\\n- Only works with Windows 8 (64-bit) and newer\\n- No audio support atm\\n- No support for Switch CFW other than Atmosph\u00e8re or Kosmos\\n\\n\\nKnown issues:\\n\\n- So far Switch crashes when put to sleep with app running (please close app beforehand, we have not fixed this issue yet)\\n- App breaks when Switch changes from docked to handheld mode or vice-versa. Please quit the app before doing so.\\n\\n\\nFurther notices:\\n\\nThis app uses core overclocking to 1785 MHz on the Nintendo Switch. We use this measure in order to decode the incoming videos efficiently. As far as we know, there have been no reported cases of this damaging any devices. In other words, it is considered safe. Still we do not warrant for any potential device damage caused by this homebrew.\\n\\n\\nTroubleshooting:\\n\\n-- Nice videos, but sadly that delay makes it unplayable --\\n\\nIf you are experiencing delays greater than 0.1 seconds, either your PC is just too slow for your chosen quality options (try worsening image quality) or your local network is bad. Basically we need instant data transfer in your network to work properly (this has nothing to do with throughput, just latency).\\nSome WiFi-routers unfortunately just aren't up to the task.\\n\\n-- These framedrops hurt my eyes! --\\n\\nYour PC is probably too slow for encoding with the games/applications on. Try other applications, lower image quality and, if you haven't already, set your PC screen resolution to 1280x720p (saves scaling).\\n\\n-- No drops, but my framerate is just very low --\\n\\nWell, in our tests we had 60 FPS on Windows 10 with low image quality... I guess you can try the same strategies as for fixing framedrops, I hope that helps.\\n\\n\\nLicense:\\n\\nThis code is licensed GPLv3 and this has a reason: We do not want to see (or read about) any parts of this project in non-open-source software (everything that is not GPLv3 licensed). Please share the notion of free code for everyone.\\n\\n\\nCredits to:\\n\\n- ffmpeg for being such a powerful media tool that we use on PC and Switch.\\n- SwitchBrew for libNX and its ffmpeg inclusion\\n- Atmosph\u00e8re for being such a great Switch CFW\\n- Captura for showing us how to capture frame input with Windows Duplication API\\n- simontime for his switch-usb-screen-stream-sharp project for Windows\\n- ScpDriverInterface for the Xbox drivers on Windows"

Creating and maintaining these tools takes a lot of time and effort. Donation link: https://ko-fi.com/W7W51JF9W6\\n\\nRewritten from the ground up:\\n\\nJKSV's rewrite aims to accomplish the following:\\n\\nClean up and modernize the codebase: The original master branch code became a mess over time and is extremely difficult to navigate and maintain.\\nZero global variables: Everything is encapsulated via interfaces. This alone makes the rewrite easier to work with and much less fragile in comparison to the original.\\nImproved error logging: The master branch did an extremely poor job at logging errors. The rewrite corrects this greatly. Each error is logged with the file, line, and column making errors and bugs easier to track down.\\nDesigned with translations in mind: Unlike the original, translations weren't a feature that were tacked on later. This also made the original difficult to maintain.\\nUse standard formats: JKSV originally used a custom file parser for data files. This has been removed in favor of JSON using libjson-c.\\nUses FsLib instead of fs_dev.c:\\nAll file operations are handled using FsLib. FsLib is a C++ wrapper I wrote around libnx's FS API.\\nFsLib also handles SD card redirection so libraries that depend on C standard I/O can read and write files to and from the SD card.\\nMore convenient Google Drive login.\\nImprove WebDav Support and code.\\nTitle Cache: Titles found on the system are cached the same way JKSM was. This improves boot time greatly on higher Switch firmware versions.\\nThe title cache is also auto-invalidating. No need to manually update it like JKSM on 3DS.\\nProper use of C++ features:\\nPolymorphism and state patterns instead of scattered global variables and logic.\\nSmart pointers to enure no memory leaks can occur.\\nC APIs wrapped in smart pointers and classes to ensure proper cleanup.\\nTemplated task system to reduce code duplication and complexity.\\nSDL textures are all wrapped and managed by a central texture manager.\\nJKSV's rewrite is a ground-up rewrite. It shares none of the original's code at all. Everything has been reworked and rewritten.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\nSupports all save data types used on Nintendo Switch:\\nAccount (User)\\nSystem\\nBCAT\\nDevice / Shared\\nTemporary\\nCache\\nSystem BCAT\\nExport Options:\\nStandard, unpacked folders for editors.\\nZIP for better compatibility.\\nNOTE: ZIP is required and enforced for cloud backup!\\nAll At Once:\\nJKSV can backup all the save data on the system or for individual users at once.\\nCloud Support:\\nIf configured, JKSV currently supports:\\nGoogle Drive\\nWebDav\\nJKSV can be configured to upload these automatically.\\nCreate Save Data:\\nJKSV can create save data for any title on your system by itself. No need to start a game to import data for it.\\nJKSV can create save data for every title found on your system at once for a single user.\\nSVI File Support:\\nImport and create save data for titles not installed on your system.\\nNOTE: These are not properly installed to the system. Use at your own discretion!\\nResize save data:\\nJKSV can extend save data to any size you would like. This is useful for games such as Minecraft.\\nCleanup Tools\\nJKSV features functions and tools to make cleanup less of a chore compared to Nintendo's Data Management and confirmation prompts:\\nJust hold A for three seconds to:\\nDelete save data for individual games.\\nDelete all save data for a single user at once.\\nStatistics:\\nView basic data and statistics about the save and title.\\nCustomizable:\\nJKSV features many options to customize it to your liking.\\nSafety:\\nJKSV can require holding to complete destructive operations or be set to make quick automatic backups upon restoring backups.",

It shares none of original version's code. The goal of this was to make JKSV more stable, navigable, and maintainable.\\n\\nAs mentioned, JKSV has been completely overhauled and rewritten.\\n\\nC++ features: JKSV now makes proper use of polymorphism, RAII, STL containers, and smart pointers throughout.\\nState system: Replaces the old mess of global variables to track state. This alone makes the code far easier to follow and maintain.\\nResource management: No more manual memory management. No more memory leaks.\\nC APIs: All C library APIs are wrapped in classes and smart pointers. This ensures proper cleanup and makes the code easier to work with.\\nError logging: Errors are logged with file, function, and line number, making issues far easier to track down.\\nCode structure and quality: Overall readability and maintainability have been drastically improved.\\nCached boot.\\n\\nFaster startup: JKSV now caches title data to improve boot times. On recent firmwares, Nintendo\u2019s changes have slowed down NsGetApplicationControlData. Caching title information resolves this issue.\\nAutomatic invalidation: JKSV detects and rebuilds the cache itself whenever new titles are detected. Unlike JKSM on 3DS, there\u2019s no need to manually refresh this yourself.\\nRemote storage heavily reworked.\\n\\nSystem overhaul: The entire remote storage system has been reworked from the ground up.\\nExpansion: The new design makes it simpler to add support for additional services in the future.\\nImportant note: Adding support depends on the information a service requires. I\u2019m not handing over all of my personal info just so JKSV can support it.\\nOverhauled WebDav code.\\n\\nCompletely reworked: The WebDav code has been rewritten from the ground up.\\nNamespace agnostic: Instead of slicing and splicing namespaces to find XML tags, the new code ignores them entirely. This eliminates unnecessary string allocations and improves compatibility.\\nRecursive fetching: Your entire WebDav listing is now fetched and processed recursively on boot, rather than on-demand. This eliminates UI pauses when servers respond slowly.\\nConsistency: Changing the output path for a title on your Switch now also updates the folder on your WebDav server automatically. This should have been like this in the first place...\\nInstructions for setting up WebDav can be found here.\\nReworked Google Drive code.\\n\\nMajor cleanup: The Google Drive integration has been heavily reworked, fixing various issues and inconsistencies.\\nFull title support: Folder names once again use full UTF-8 titles. This was changed with the previous WebDav implementation and has been reverted.\\nNew login method: Instead of relying on the Switch\u2019s built-in web browser, JKSV now uses the Limited Input method. You can now log in with your phone or another device instead.\\nInstructions for setting up Google Drive can be found here.\\nReworked file handling logic.\\n\\nComplete overhaul: All file handling logic has been rewritten from the ground up.\\nBug fix: This addresses a rare issue where JKSV could get stuck at the end of a file transfer.\\nReworked UI Code.\\n\\nComplete overhaul: All UI code and elements have been rewritten and fine-tuned.\\nFamiliar Layout: The interface remains familiar, but everything underneath is completely different.\\nBetter translation support: The UI was designed from the ground up with translations in mind. In the original, this was just tacked on later.\\nText Menu (JKSM 2016) Mode Returns: For fans of the original JKSM on 3DS, JKSV now supports JKSM Mode where titles are listed using text menus instead of an icon grid array.\\nAdditions.\\n\\nAuto-Upload: JKSV can now automatically upload backups to your selected service and remove them from the SD card.\\nControllable compression level: You can set the compression level used when creating zipped backups.\\nText Menu (JKSM) mode: Toggle between icon grids and text menus for displaying titles.\\nToggleable System Saves: You can now toggle whether scanning, loading, and display Device, BCAT, Cache, and System is desired. Disabling all of them also improves boot times.\\nJKSV now includes a metadata file in backups containing information about the save. This improves accuracy and reliability when restoring saves.\\nNotes concerning missing features.\\n\\nInclude Device Saves with Users hasn't been implemented yet. It requires some careful consideration and planning.\\nFile Mode is not available yet.\\nFiltering paths from backup and deletion is not yet implemented.\\nAdditional Notes.\\n\\nMost backups from the original JKSV are compatible. Exceptions include titles that extend save data, which are now handled correctly in the rewrite.\\nThe SVI format has been revised. SVI files from the original JKSV are not compatible with this rewrite.\\nThe translations provided are all completed by AI. If you have revisions or would like to fix them, feel free to do so!\\nSome work may still be needed regarding cache type saves and handling them.\\nJKSV's rewrite does not use the same configuration file as the original. You will need to reconfigure it.\\nExtra, extra notes:\\n\\nUses FsLib, a C++ wrapper library I wrote around 3DS and Switch FS calls.\\n\\nMore control: FsLib allows me finer control over file operations.\\nFor example, if the final size of a file is known ahead of time, FsLib can skip redundant calls to extend the file during writes. This speeds up file transfers.\\nPaths are standardized upon construction to ensure compatibility with the Switch's FS.\\nImproved error handling and logging: Every operation returns whether it succeeded. If not, FsLib records an internal error string with the location and error code for easier debugging.\\nBecause of this, the option Use FS Commands Directly has been removed as it serves no purpose anymore.\\nUses SDLLib, a C++ wrapper library I wrote containing reusable functions all of my projects share.\\n\\nCentral Texture Manager: All textures are now loaded, tracked, and freed by a single manager, eliminating duplicate handling.\\nSurfaces & Textures wrapped: SDL Surfaces and Textures are wrapped in smart pointers or classes, ensuring proper cleanup.\\nImproved text handling: Text handling has been reworked and improved compared to the original JKSV implementation.\\nTL;DR\\n\\nThis is effectively a completely different program. It looks like JKSV, runs like JKSV, but it's a completely different beast.\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nI don\u2019t expect it, and it\u2019s absolutely not required, but rewriting JKSV to be the best it can be has, and still is, taking a lot of time and hard work. If you\u2019d like to show your appreciation, you can now, and I truly do appreciate it.\\n\\nURL: https://ko-fi.com/W7W51JF9W6",

            "details": "This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of Max Payne Mobile. It loads the original game binary, patches it and runs it. This is probably not entirely stable yet, so expect issues.\\n\\nThis is a port of the PS Vita version adapted to work on the Switch with AArch64 .so files.\\n\\n\\nYou're going to need:\\n\\n.apk file for version 1.7 (latest version at the time of writing) that includes arm64-v8a libraries;\\n.obb file for version 1.6 or 1.7 (usually located at /sdcard/android/obb/com.rockstar.maxpayne/main.3.com.rockstar.maxpayne.obb).\\nBoth files can be obtained from your phone if you have a copy of the game installed. Both files can be opened or extracted with anything that can extract .zip files.\\n\\nTo install:\\n\\nCreate a folder called maxpayne in the switch folder on your SD card.\\nExtract the contents of the assets folder from your .apk to /switch/maxpayne/.\\nExtract lib/arm64-v8a/libMaxPayne.so from your .apk to /switch/maxpayne/.\\nExtract the contents of the .obb file into /switch/maxpayne/. You can skip all the .msf files except for MaxPayneSoundsv2.msf and any extra languages that you want.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nThis will not work in applet/album mode: even though MEMORY_MB can very well be lowered to 232MB in config.h, there's still 0MB left after the newlib heap is allocated. This can probably be fixed later. For now use a game override or NSP hbmenu.\\n\\nThe port has an extra config file, located at /switch/maxpayne/config.txt. It is created when you first run the game and allows you to tweak some internal settings. For more detailed descriptions of said settings check the wiki article.\\n\\nThe game will show an error message if it detects that anything is wrong. Please read those and check the relevant parts of your setup.\\n\\nIf the error says Could not find symbol ..., that likely means you have the wrong .apk or .so file. You need version 1.7, others will not work. Make sure also that you've extracted libMaxPayne.so from the arm64-v8a subfolder.\\n\\nIf the game crashes on startup, please post an issue with your last crash report attached."

Others will run much faster than they did before. Be warned that maximum overclock will probably heat up your Switch more than normal and extensive use might negatively affect your system.\\n\\nv0.4\\n\\n-Added screen rotation and screen layout settings; functionality is identical to desktop melonDS\\n-The emulation window is now drawn with OpenGL\\n-Having Vsync on is now just as fast as having it off\\n-Vsync option has been removed\\n\\nNOTE: Don't get too excited by the OpenGL! I'm only using it to draw the software renderer's output to the screen. There is NO speed boost from this right now. Yes, there is a bit of a speed boost in this build, but it has little to do with OpenGL.\\n\\nv0.3.1\\nFix sound output\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nmelonDS was just bumped to version 0.7 a few hours ago, so here's another release from me as well! This release comes with an options menu containing four whole options (crazy, I know). I've also reworked some things to prevent flickering when navigating the menus.\\n\\nThe options added include:\\nBoot game directly - Disabling this will allow you to boot into the DS firmware instead of automatically running a game.\\nThreaded 3D renderer - Speeds up 3D rendering; you probably don't want to turn this off.\\nVsync - While not technically being Vsync, the functionality is similar enough. Disabling this will let the screen render without waiting for a frame to finish. It'll give you a performance increase at the cost of screen tearing and minor artifacts.\\nAudio output - Self-explanatory. Disable to sacrifice audio for a small performance boost.\\n\\nThe first two options are actual melonDS options, while the last two are custom ones I added for the purpose of increasing performance. You still probably won't get full speed, and the trade-offs may or may not be worth it, but at least it's something.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nThis release features the latest commits from upstream melonDS, which mainly feature the addition of experimental savestates. To use savestates on the Switch port, press L to save and R to load. You only get one slot per game. This is only temporary until I make some sort of actual menu system. Note that the DS L and R buttons are mapped to the Switch ZL and ZR buttons; don't get them mixed up!",

            "details": "I present to you my own original NES emulator for the Switch, NoiES! This entire emulator was written from scratch by me. I started this project just to teach myself about how emulators are made so that I can work on larger projects in the future, but it went farther than I originally expected and is now pretty much a full-fledged emulator, apart from some minor inaccuracies and some missing mappers.\\n\\nBut there are already other NES emulators for the Switch, why use this one?\\nWell, no reason in particular. As I said before, this was more a learning experience for me, but I ported it to the Switch for the homebrew bounty and I might as well release it. I suppose the biggest advantage I can offer is that since I developed the entire emulator core myself I am very familiar with it and can easily dive in to fix bugs and add new features.\\n\\nMinor inaccuracies?\\nYes, well, I've yet to test my CPU timing for cycle accuracy so no promises there. There are also some minor timing issues with the PPU, particularly with the MMC3 IRQ counter, which can be seen in the slight vibration of the status bar in Kirby's Adventure. Another odd bug I found is that I can't seem to navigate the items menu in The Legend of Zelda. Oh, and the audio system is still kind of a work in progress, so you might notice crackles (especially in docked mode!), missing sounds, or things that sound slightly off. (Wow, doing a great job selling it here)\\n\\nMappers?\\nRight. Every ROM has a mapper; it's basically what loads different portions of the ROM memory into the CPU memory for execution. I've implemented mappers 1 through 4, which should cover a large portion of the NES library. If you have any particular games you want to play that aren't supported, tell me the mapper number (the emulator will tell you which one it is if it isn't supported) so I can place higher priority on implementing it."

In docked mode, linear gives a slightly blurry image, and sharp nearest neighbor gives perfectly sharp pixels.\\nGeneral image quality improvements in both docked and handheld mode. The internal rendering now dynamically switches resolution between 1080p and 720p instead of always rendering at 720p. Also, the mouse pointer looks a bit sharper now in handheld mode.\\nThe window scaling option now works and can be used to blow up or shrink down the whole game screen, including the user interface.\\nDifferent game resolutions should also work in principle now.

Although he was forced by Zhao's nanny to marry Zhao and remain on the island forever, he manages to escape with the medicine and succeeds in healing his aunt. However, he loses memory of his encounter on the island because he was tricked into consuming a memory-erasing drug earlier. When he meets Zhao again, he does not remember her but still saves her from a group of enemies, who have destroyed her home and murdered her nanny. He then decides to accompany her to southwestern China in search of her mother, who might still be alive.\\n\\nFollow the source link for more detailed instruction and controls."

This is more visible when using http streams, of course.\\n\\npPlay can stream media from an http server with directory listing enabled. To do so, you must edit the pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg) to add your server address (NETWORK = 'http://samples.ffmpeg.org/';). Please note that you need a good and stable network connection for this, and you will probably have to set buffering to \"VeryHigh\" for smoother experience.\\n\\npPlay will extract media information in background, but i did spot a very few files which make the device crash. If so, you can disable this in pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg): CACHE_MEDIA_INFO = 0;\\n\\npPlay will push the cpu speed when a 1080p media is played, and restore previous speed when paused or stopped. This is safe but can be disabled in the main option menu (left).\\n\\nPlease note that there is a (big?) delay when switching video/audio/subtitles streams to see the change. This is worked on but in the meantime, be patient :)"

            "details": "Let the switch remotely play PC games (similar to steam link or remote play)\\n\\nFor instructions, please see the instructions folder in the repo.\\n\\nThis project is inspired by the github project In-Home-Switching and SkyNX. The goal is to make a convenient streamer/client application to be used to remote play PC games on the switch.\\n\\nIn-Home-Switching and SkyNX already offer the ability to do so, however there were some convenience features missing that I wanted to add. I also recently was studying multi-threading and when I saw the code, I thought 'this is the perfect chance to try writing it in C++'.\\n\\nNote\\nThe video stream is CPU dependent as at the moment it uses the ffmpeg option of hwaccel auto which usually results in ffmpeg picking CPU for the screen capture process. In my initial prototyping phase I found choosing the AMD GPU option for ffmpeg led to inconsistent stream results. I will look at making the hwaccel option configurable in the future but for now just keep in mind CPU is important.\\n\\nIf you're playing a game that is CPU intensive then there's a high chance the stream will have skips or hiccups. If your CPU is weak, then it'll be hard for it to produce and push the frames quick enough.\\n\\nFor my PC, when I play Nier Automata there are no hiccups and I can get near 60 fps depending on the stream settings (1280 x 720 desktop res, and 5mb/s bitrate). But when I tried playing RE3 2020 at 30 or 56fps I was getting hiccups and skips. So please keep this in mind.\\n\\nFeatures\\n No system crashing when going to sleep (stream will disconnect though and application is closeable)\\n Desktop application to host remote connection stream\\n Stream input from the switch to remote connection\\n Stream audio from remote connection to the switch\\n Automatically connect switch and PC stream applications\\n Automatically mute PC when audio is streaming to the Switch\\n Allow manual configuration of switch to PC connection\\n Configure stream settings from switch\\n Disconnect / Reconnect stream at will\\n Toggle Input Mode to Mouse\\n Toggle Input Mode to DS4(PS4) controller\\n Toggle Input Mode to Xbox controller\\nSwitch-Project\\nThis project consists of an application written for the switch that will decode stream data received from FFMPEG and send its input to an application to emulate a controller. The rendering is done with SDL2 and the project is written in C++.\\n\\nTested on:\\n\\nAtmosphere 0.14.1 - FW 10.1.0 (switch-remote-play 0.7.2)\\nAtmosphere 0.16.2 - FW 10.1.0 (switch-remote-play 0.7.2)\\nWindows-Project\\nThis project consists of an application written for Windows that will launch an FFMPEG stream to encode and send data. The application, after launching the FFMPEG stream, will then listen to receive input data and emulate a controller via the ViGEm Client SDK. The ViGEm Client SDK expects the ViGEm Bus Kernel Driver to be installed on the machine in order to work. For more info on the kernel driver code see the ViGEmBus github page. For the driver installation, see the ViGEmBus Releases page.\\n\\nThe Windows project is also written in C++ and uses Winsock to do socket communication with the switch application.\\n\\nTested on:\\n\\nWindows 10 64 bit\\nRyzen 5 2600 3.4GHz\\nAMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB\\n16GB RAM\\nKnown Issues\\nStream Performance\\nThe stream performance is heavily dependent on network connectivity and your PC CPU performance. Configuration settings will need to be played with the find what works well with your network + PC environment.\\n\\nI recommend playing with the 'Encoder Preset' and 'Quality Control Factor' values while keeping bitrate at 8192 or less.\\n\\nGeneral tips\\nPreset value controls how the encoder should work: ultrafast means the encoder performs to get the image out as fast as possible ignoring quality, and veryslow means the encoder can take its time to preserve image quality.\\nCodec value can help performance however I have tested both the AMF and standard h264 and don't notice much of a difference.\\nQuality control factor is what controls how good the image should be. The lower the value the harder your PC must work to maintain quality. (this value and 'Preset' are what will dictate your CPU's workload)\\nFor more info see the ffmpeg documentation.\\nConfig examples\\nGreat image quality config:\\nPreset - veryslow\\nQuality control factor - less than 10 (0 = perfect image)\\nBitrate - around 5000 - 8000\\nVsync Mode - variable frame rate\\nLatency oriented config:\\nPreset - ultrafast\\nQuality control factor - 20+\\nBitrate - around 5000\\nVsync Mode - variable frame rate\\nI haven't tested all configuration combinations (and these are dependent on my PC specs), so if you find one that works great please feel free to send it to me with your PC specs and network environment configuration :)\\n\\nRare crash when opening some homebrew apps\\nThe crash issue in v0.7.2 has been found and patched. (it was due to the network discovery feature not being shutdown correctly) The app still crashes however it is harder to reproduce now and I haven't found a proper 100% way to reproduce the crash yet. The current crashing issue is rare and only crashes hbloader/hbmenu when opening an app after streaming for a certain while. I can't reproduce it but it's gone for now. If anyone figures out how to reproduce the crash, please let me know."

            "details": "Custom, open-source replacement/reimplementation for Nintendo Switch's HOME menu (qlaunch), extending it with amazing, homebrew-oriented functionality!\\n\\nuLaunch is a very ambitious project, consisting on two custom library applets, a custom system application and a custom system applet, in order to replace the console's HOME menu with a custom, homebrew-oriented one.\\n\\nThis isn't any kind of HOME menu extension, injection, patch, etc. uLaunch is a complete reimplementation, 100% open-source, which also takes over eShop and Parental control applets and flog system title (all of them are pretty much useless with this reimpl) for its extended functionality.\\n\\nThe project is licensed as GPLv2.\\n\\nFor those who are interested in how the UI was done, this project is, like Goldleaf, a good example of how powerful Plutonium libraries can be in order to make beautiful UIs.\\n\\nFeatures\\nList of HOME menu features uLaunch has:\\n\\nProper launching and foreground management: launch, suspend and close titles and applets\\n\\nProper general channel handling (some of it might be not implemented): sleep, shutdown, reboot, HOME menu press detection...\\n\\nSettings:\\n\\nShow connected WiFi network's name\\n\\nOpen connection applet in case user wants to change network settings\\n\\nChange console's language and show active one\\n\\nChange console's nickname and show current one\\n\\nUser features:\\n\\nAllow creating user on the startup menu\\n\\nShow user's page (in order to edit nickname, icon, friends...)\\n\\nHomebrew support\\n\\nLaunching as applets (no need of Album!)\\n\\nLaunching as applications (no need of any titles to do so!)\\n\\nCustom basic homebrew menu\\n\\nOption to add custom NRO accessors to main menu (homebrew or custom items easily accessible, no more need of forwarders!)\\n\\nUI\\n\\nThemes (different to official HOME menu themes/NXThemes)\\n\\nCustom icons, menu assets and graphics (custom images, colors, sizes, positions...), background...\\n\\nCustom background music and sound effects!\\n\\nFolders in order to keep your main menu organized!\\n\\nUsers\\n\\nPC-like login on startup (select user and use it for everything, log off, register/change/remove password...)\\n\\nUser password support! (up to 15 characters)\\n\\nMiscellaneous extras\\n\\nWeb browsing (via web-applet) directly from the main menu!\\n\\nConsole screen capturing from PC itself (Windows-only) via USB-C cable and uViewer tool!\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nHomebrew-as-application 'flog' takeover\\nuLaunch allows you to launch homebrew as an application, taking advantage of the system's 'flog' built-in application title, which was stubbed but not removed, thus it's content can be overriden via LayeredFS and launched.\\n\\nSince launching this title should be impossible, it might involve ban risk. uLaunch has this option disabled by default, so enable and use it use it at your own risk. Always make youre you're safe from bans (by using tools like 90DNS) before using uLaunch to avoid any possible risks.",
            "changelog": "v1.2.2\\nChangelog\\n\\n- Recompiled with Atmosph\u00e8re v1.10.1 support (21.1.0)\\n\\n- Moved to new NS commands for proper icon/NACP support\\n\\n1.2.1\\nSome changes/fixes below are still experimental (particularly for users with a lot of games installed), so please report any weird/new issues you find!\\nRecompiled with Atmosph\u00e8re v1.9.1 support (20.1.0)\\n\\nIntroduced a new game icon/NACP caching system to circumvent issues with 20.x icon/NACP loading slowdowns:\\n\\n- Icon/NACP data is stored in-memory in uSystem, which is why uSystem's memory footprint increases from 12MB to around 40MB: this should, in theory, allow cache for up to 200 installed games. If anyone happens to have more than this amount installed, then (even though this is already an absurd amount) feel free to open an issue to request more cache memory (we could theoretically use up to around 50MB)\\n\\n- Don't worry, since this shouldn't impact anything: we are already using less memory than the base HOME menu (which is around 50MB) even considering the resulting size of the uSystem binary, we have been for years and still are, so (as always) things will be the same as with regular HOME menu, maybe even smoother\\n\\nFixed a bug causing major slowdowns for users with many games (even with around 10 it was noticeable), also related to 20.x changes, where a given command was called every frame (for every app) and made uMenu slow down whenever too many games were in view in the main menu (the value is now read just once when the apps are loaded)\\n\\nFixed a dumb bug where uMenu would only try to cache the active theme if it was not cached yet... while uSystem was wiping ALL cache every reboot, thus the theme was being cached every boot\\n\\nFixed a weird bug where (sometimes?) the default theme would be considered outdated",
